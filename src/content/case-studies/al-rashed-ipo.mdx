## Valuation Analysis

### Comparable Company Analysis

| Company | P/E | P/B | EV/EBITDA |
|---------|-----|-----|-----------|
| Al Rashed Foods | 12.0x | 2.14x | 8.5x |
| Sector Median | 15.5x | 2.80x | 11.2x |
| Premium/(Discount) | (22.6%) | (23.6%) | (24.1%) |

### DCF Valuation

---

## Financial Summary

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Revenue (SAR M) | 1,980 | 2,240 | 2,500 |
| Net Income (SAR M) | 285 | 330 | 375 |
| Net Margin | 14.4% | 14.7% | 15.0% |
| ROE | 16.2% | 17.1% | 17.9% |

---

## Recommendation

**Hold** — Al Rashed Foods is a well-run company in a growing market, but the modest upside from current levels does not warrant an aggressive Buy recommendation. We would become more constructive on a pullback below SAR 43.00 or evidence of accelerating margin expansion.

**Target Price: SAR 48.00** | **Upside: 6.7%**
