{/* IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: A world map with capital flow arrows pointing toward Saudi Arabia (TASI), with the February 2026 date highlighted, and a small inset showing the TASI vs Nomu access difference */}

February 1, 2026 marked the most significant structural change to Saudi Arabia's capital markets in a decade.

On that date, the Capital Market Authority (CMA) eliminated the Qualified Foreign Investor (QFI) concept, granting **direct foreign investor access to TASI** — the main market — without intermediation, swap agreements, or complex licensing requirements. For the first time, any investor anywhere in the world can access Saudi Arabia's main equity market in the same way as a domestic participant.

The immediate picture before this change took effect:
- **4.87% foreign ownership** of TASI (SAR 466B of SAR 9.56T market cap)
- **1.49% foreign ownership** of Nomu (SAR 0.6B of SAR 40.5B market cap)

The implications extend well beyond headline statistics. This structural change alters the IPO venue decision calculus, reshapes sector valuation hierarchies, and widens the gap between TASI and Nomu in a way that matters practically for companies making listing decisions today.

## What Changed: The QFI Regime Explained

### The Old Regime (Pre-February 1, 2026)

Foreign investors seeking exposure to TASI previously required a Qualified Foreign Investor (QFI) licence. The process involved:
- Formal application through Tadawul
- Minimum capital requirements
- Documentation and ongoing compliance obligations
- For many international funds: indirect access via swap agreements (to avoid the QFI complexity)

**Practical effect:** Only large, sophisticated foreign institutions navigated the QFI system. Retail foreign investors were effectively excluded. This complexity was consistently cited as an access-friction discount embedded in TASI valuations — typically estimated at 2–3 percentage points below what direct-access markets command.

**Nomu impact:** QFI rules applied to Nomu as well, on top of Nomu's own domestic qualified-investor restrictions. Nomu's foreign ownership was effectively negligible as a result (1.49%).

### The New Regime (Post-February 1, 2026)

**Direct foreign access:**
- No QFI licence required for TASI investment
- Simplified, standardised account opening for non-residents
- Standard KYC/AML procedures — no Saudi-specific regulatory burden beyond what is standard globally
- Same access conditions as Saudi national investors

**Who can now invest:**
- Foreign institutional investors — pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, mutual funds
- Foreign retail investors — individuals from any country
- Previously excluded categories now eligible without restriction

**Nomu status: unchanged.** Qualified investor restrictions remain in place for Nomu. Foreign investors who do not meet Saudi qualified investor criteria (SAR 40M+ in securities, or equivalent professional certification) remain effectively excluded from Nomu.

---

## Why the CMA Made This Change

**Vision 2030 capital markets development:** The goal is for Saudi Arabia to become a global financial hub comparable to Dubai or Abu Dhabi. Foreign ownership depth is a key marker of market credibility and maturity.

**MSCI Emerging Market eligibility:** MSCI requires accessible markets for emerging market inclusion. The QFI mechanism's complexity was a structural barrier. Direct access removes the primary objection.

**Liquidity enhancement:** Deeper investor pools tighten bid-ask spreads, reduce domestic market volatility, and create more continuous price discovery.

**Valuation premium:** Global comparable analysis suggests that emerging markets with open foreign access trade at 8–12% premium versus restricted markets with equivalent fundamentals.

## Current Foreign Ownership State (January 2026)

### TASI Breakdown

**Aggregate numbers:**
- Total TASI market cap: SAR 9.56 trillion (January 2026)
- Foreign ownership: SAR 466 billion (4.87%)
- Growth trajectory: +15% annually (2023–2025)

**Sector distribution:**

| Sector | Foreign Ownership | Rationale |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Banking | 7.2% | Dividend yields; globally familiar business model |
| Petrochemicals | 6.8% | Global commodity exposure; internationally understood |
| Aviation | 5.5% | Tourism theme; Flynas IPO attracted international capital |
| Healthcare | 4.9% | Defensive sector; medical tourism appeal |
| Telecom | 4.2% | Regulated utility; stable returns |
| Consumer | 3.8% | Domestic growth story |
| Real Estate | 2.1% | Local knowledge-intensive; regulatory complexity |
| Industrial | 1.9% | Domestic focus; limited global comparables |

**Pattern:** Foreign capital concentrates in liquid, internationally intelligible sectors and avoids local-knowledge-intensive areas. Banking, petrochemicals, aviation, and healthcare dominate.

### Nomu Foreign Ownership

- Total Nomu market cap: SAR 40.5 billion
- Foreign ownership: SAR 0.6 billion (1.49%)
- TASI has 3.3x more foreign participation as a percentage — and this gap is set to widen significantly under the new regime

---

## Valuation Impact: Quantifying the Foreign Access Premium

### The +5–8% TASI Valuation Boost

The premium operates through three distinct mechanisms.

**Mechanism 1: Elimination of complexity discount (+2–3%)**

The QFI friction embedded an estimated 2–3% discount in TASI multiples. International investors priced in the additional cost and uncertainty of the QFI structure — this discount disappears with direct access.

**Mechanism 2: Incremental demand (+2–3%)**

Projected inflows: SAR 350–600 billion over two years.
TASI market cap: SAR 9.56 trillion.
Incremental demand as a share of market: approximately 3.7–6.3%.
Assuming 50% of this represents net new buying pressure (the rest going to improved liquidity): approximately 2–3% price impact.

**Mechanism 3: Multiple convergence (+1–2%)**

International investors apply global sector multiples. Previously, access friction meant Saudi multiples were discounted relative to global benchmarks. Direct access removes the discount and allows multiples to converge toward international levels, particularly in sectors with obvious global comparables.

**Total estimated gain: 5–8%**

### Which Sectors Benefit Most?

**Tier 1: Maximum benefit (+7–10%)**

*Aviation and tourism (Flynas, future tourism plays):*
Global theme with obvious international comparables (airlines, hotel chains, travel platforms). Tourism transformation narrative is internationally compelling. Leisure travel investors and specialist tourism funds now have direct access.

*Healthcare (Fakeeh Care, Sulaiman Al Habib, medical tourism):*
Defensive sector with global institutional appeal. Medical tourism generates genuine international revenue exposure. Aging demographics and chronic disease management are global themes that international health-focused funds recognise.

*Consumer Discretionary (retail, e-commerce, entertainment):*
Emerging market consumption story is well-understood globally. Rising middle-class narrative has direct analogues in other markets that international investors have tracked for decades. Global retail multiples now applicable without the access discount.

**Tier 2: Moderate benefit (+4–6%)**

*Banking and financial services:* Already has 7.2% foreign ownership (mature participation). Incremental demand is meaningful but the marginal effect is lower than sectors with previously low foreign participation.

*Petrochemicals:* Commodity exposure was already accessible through the QFI system for sophisticated institutions. The incremental new demand is primarily from retail and smaller institutions that previously found the QFI system prohibitive.

*Telecom:* Yield-focused international investors are a genuine new demand layer, but the regulated utility profile limits the magnitude of re-rating.

**Tier 3: Minimal benefit (+1–3%)**

*Real estate:* Foreign investors without local knowledge are disadvantaged in this sector. Regulatory complexity around ownership and Zakat treatment adds uncertainty.

*Industrial manufacturing:* Primarily domestic revenue focus. Limited global comparables. Capital-intensive with longer investment horizons.

## The Widening TASI/Nomu Gap

The February 2026 change permanently increases the structural valuation gap between TASI and Nomu.

### Before February 2026

| Component | TASI/Nomu Premium |
|-----------|------------------|
| Liquidity premium | 10–15% |
| Investor base advantage | 5–8% |
| Governance and credibility | 2–4% |
| **Total** | **17–27%** |

### After February 2026

| Component | TASI/Nomu Premium |
|-----------|------------------|
| Liquidity premium | 10–15% (unchanged) |
| Investor base advantage | **8–13%** (increased by 3–5 points) |
| Governance and credibility | 2–4% (unchanged) |
| **Total** | **20–32%** |

**Incremental gap: +3–5 percentage points** purely from the foreign access differential.

### Sector-Specific Gap Changes

| Sector | Pre-Feb 2026 Gap | Post-Feb 2026 Gap | Increase |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| Aviation and tourism | 22% | 30% | +8 points |
| Healthcare | 23% | 30% | +7 points |
| Consumer | 20% | 26% | +6 points |
| Banking | 18% | 22% | +4 points |
| Industrial | 28% | 30% | +2 points |

For Nomu-listed companies in internationally appealing sectors, the cost of remaining on Nomu — relative to a TASI-listed peer — has just increased meaningfully.

## Expected Foreign Ownership Growth Trajectory

### Projections (2026–2028)

**Starting point (January 2026):** 4.87% (SAR 466B)

**2027 projection:** 7.5–8.5% (SAR 750–850B)
Incremental inflow: SAR 284–384B — driven by the first wave of previously excluded investors establishing positions

**2028 projection:** 10–12% (SAR 1.0–1.2T)
Approaching steady state comparable to other MSCI Emerging Market economies

### Inflow Sources

| Source | Share of Incremental Inflows | Estimated Amount |
|--------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| Passive index funds (MSCI, FTSE trackers) | 40% | SAR 200–300B |
| Active foreign institutions | 35% | SAR 175–250B |
| Foreign retail and HNW individuals | 15% | SAR 75–125B |
| Hedge funds and tactical investors | 10% | SAR 50–75B |

Passive index fund flows are particularly significant because they are mechanical — they occur automatically as foreign tracking funds replicate index weights, without requiring active investment decisions.

## Strategic Implications for IPO Planning

### For Companies Deciding Between TASI and Nomu

**The decision calculus has shifted for borderline cases.**

Companies with SAR 300–400M market cap that might previously have chosen Nomu to avoid compliance costs should now run an explicit analysis of the foreign access premium. If the company is in aviation, healthcare, consumer, or technology — the post-February 2026 TASI premium on these sectors likely justifies the additional compliance cost.

The incremental gap is 3–5 percentage points. For a SAR 300M company, that represents SAR 9–15M in valuation impact — which compares directly against SAR 6–10M in incremental TASI compliance costs over three to four years. The maths is closer than it was in 2025.

### For Nomu Companies Considering Transfer

Transfer urgency has increased.

**Pre-February 2026 transfer case:**
- Expected valuation uplift on transfer: 15–22%
- For a SAR 500M company: SAR 75–110M gain within six to twelve months

**Post-February 2026 transfer case:**
- Expected valuation uplift on transfer: 18–25% (for internationally appealing sectors)
- For a SAR 500M company: SAR 90–125M gain, with ongoing foreign participation premium
- Additional ongoing benefit from foreign capital participation available only on TASI

For companies with market cap above SAR 200M that are eligible for TASI graduation, the opportunity cost of remaining on Nomu is higher today than at any point since Nomu's launch.

### For New TASI IPOs: International Roadshows

**A new capability now has clear ROI:**

The traditional Saudi IPO roadshow was entirely domestic and regional — Riyadh, Jeddah, Dubai.

A post-February 2026 roadshow for a TASI IPO above SAR 500M now justifiably includes London (international institutions), New York (global funds), and Singapore (Asian sovereign wealth and institutions).

**Estimated ROI:**
- Incremental roadshow cost: SAR 2–3M (travel, materials, management time)
- Incremental foreign demand: 5–10% of offering
- Valuation impact from international demand: 2–4% higher pricing
- On a SAR 1B offering: SAR 20–40M in higher proceeds

Return: 7–13x on roadshow investment. For any TASI deal above SAR 500M, omitting international marketing is a material financial decision.

## What Foreign Investors Look For

Understanding foreign investor requirements helps companies prepare effectively.

**English disclosure quality:**
Professionally translated prospectus, quarterly reports available in English, and management fluent enough to conduct investor calls in English. Poor English disclosure is a decision trigger for most international institutions — they simply will not invest in companies they cannot analyse in detail.

**International accounting standards:**
IFRS adoption and Big 4 audit firms are strong positives. International investors apply global sector multiples; they need to trust that the financials are prepared consistently with how those multiples were derived.

**Corporate governance transparency:**
Independent directors — ideally including some with international experience — audit committee with external experts, and thorough related-party transaction disclosure. ESG reporting is increasingly a threshold requirement for large international pension funds and sovereign wealth.

**Liquidity assurance:**
30%+ free float, daily volume above SAR 10M, committed market makers. International institutions will not build positions in stocks they cannot exit. Low liquidity means they either apply a significant discount or pass entirely.

**Sector understandability:**
Business models with obvious global comparables are accessible to international investors. Companies with highly localised models that lack global analogues face a steeper education curve — and international investors with tight research budgets will default to more familiar options.

## Saudi Arabia's Competitive Position in MENA

### GCC Market Access Comparison (January 2026)

| Market | Foreign Access | Foreign Ownership | Market Cap | IPO Attractiveness |
|--------|---------------|------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Saudi TASI | Direct (Feb 2026) | 4.87% → 10–12% | $2.5T | Very High |
| UAE ADX | Direct | 15–20% | $850B | High |
| Qatar QE | Direct | 10–12% | $180B | Moderate |
| Kuwait Boursa | Direct | 8–10% | $150B | Moderate |
| Oman MSX | Restricted | 3–5% | $20B | Limited |

Saudi Arabia's combination of scale ($2.5T market cap), newly direct foreign access, Vision 2030 transformation narrative, and deep domestic liquidity (6.5M retail investors) creates a compelling positioning advantage for large-cap IPOs.

**Remaining gap versus UAE:** UAE ADX has 15–20% foreign ownership versus Saudi's 4.87%. This reflects two decades of open market experience, MSCI Emerging Market status, and historically simpler access mechanics. Saudi Arabia is closing the gap — but from a lower base.

## Key Takeaways

1. **February 1, 2026:** QFI eliminated — direct foreign access to TASI; Nomu structure unchanged and remains domestically focused
2. **Starting point:** 4.87% TASI foreign ownership (SAR 466B) versus 1.49% Nomu (SAR 0.6B) — a 3.3x gap set to widen further
3. **TASI valuation boost:** +5–8% aggregate; +7–10% for internationally appealing sectors (aviation, healthcare, consumer)
4. **Gap widening:** TASI/Nomu structural premium increased by 3–5 percentage points, from 17–27% to 20–32%
5. **Sector winners:** Aviation and tourism, healthcare, consumer — largest foreign demand. Industrial — minimal foreign benefit
6. **Transfer urgency:** Nomu companies above SAR 200M market cap should model the post-February 2026 transfer ROI; the numbers have improved
7. **IPO venue threshold shifts:** SAR 300–400M companies previously borderline between Nomu and TASI should revisit the analysis — the foreign access premium may now justify direct TASI
8. **International roadshows:** SAR 500M+ TASI IPOs should include London, New York, Singapore marketing — the ROI is now clearly positive
9. **Foreign investor requirements:** English disclosure, IFRS accounting, 33%+ independent directors, 30%+ free float, SAR 10M+ daily volume
10. **Competitive positioning:** Saudi Arabia is now the most compelling MENA IPO venue for large-cap deals, combining market size, new foreign access, and Vision 2030 momentum
