{/* IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: A forensic-style breakdown diagram showing the four main failure categories (overpricing, weak equity story, poor timing, inadequate track record) with percentage weights next to each */}

Not every IPO makes it to the listing bell.

In 2025, Saudi Arabia recorded **six IPO cancellations** - one on TASI and five on Nomu - representing companies that invested months of management time and millions of riyals in preparation, only to withdraw before completion.

What separates successful IPOs from failures? The data reveals three primary culprits:
- **Overpricing:** 40% of failures
- **Weak equity story:** 25% of failures
- **Poor timing:** 20% of failures

Understanding failure mechanics matters because prevention is significantly cheaper than cure. A cancelled IPO typically wastes SAR 2–5M in sunk advisory and preparation costs, damages the company's market reputation, and consumes 12–18 months of management attention that could have been spent running the business.

This piece dissects 2025's cancellations, establishes the critical viability thresholds, and provides a pre-IPO risk assessment framework.

## 2025 Cancelled IPOs: The Full Picture

### TASI Cancellation: Arabian Oud

- **Sector:** Consumer goods (luxury fragrances and perfumes)
- **Status:** Withdrawn pre-launch, before prospectus filing
- **Official reason:** "Decided not to proceed after advisor consultation"

**Analysis:** This was a strategic withdrawal rather than a market rejection. Arabian Oud and its advisors likely determined that 2025 market conditions - TASI returned -6.8% for the year - made the timing suboptimal for a premium consumer luxury IPO where valuation expectations were ambitious. The decision to withdraw before filing publicly preserved optionality and avoided the reputational cost of a failed subscription.

**Key lesson:** Sometimes the most commercially sound decision is not to launch. Advisors who recommend withdrawal when market and valuation conditions are misaligned are doing their job.

### Nomu Cancellations: Five Cases

**1. Alwazn Almithaly (Consumer Goods - Health & Wellness)**

Planned offer size: SAR 346 million
Cancellation reason: Insufficient total subscription coverage

This case is one of the most instructive of 2025 because it demonstrates a critical nuance: **high institutional oversubscription is not sufficient if retail fails.**

**What happened:**
- Institutional tranche (approximately 70%): 450x oversubscription - a striking headline
- Retail tranche (approximately 30%): below 100% subscribed
- Combined total: approximately 1.2x coverage - below the 1.5x Nomu minimum

**Why retail failed:**
- Share price point too high (SAR 60+ per share), making minimum investment inaccessible for many retail participants
- Limited consumer brand recognition - health and wellness products with B2B-heavy distribution
- Weak Sharia compliance narrative, effectively excluding a large portion of the retail investor base
- Launched during a market correction, when retail investors were risk-averse

**Key lesson:** On Nomu, both tranches must work. Institutional enthusiasm does not compensate for retail undersubscription because the qualifying thresholds apply to total coverage, not institutional coverage alone.

---

**2. Lavenco (Manufacturing)**

Cancellation reason: Undersubscribed offering
Root cause: Overpricing relative to sector peers

**What happened:**

```
Lavenco's ask: 18x P/E
Comparable Nomu industrials: 10–12x P/E
Implied premium demanded: approximately 64%
```

To justify a 64% premium to established sector peers, Lavenco would have needed to demonstrate materially superior revenue growth, significantly better EBITDA margins, or a credible market share leadership position. The prospectus did not support any of these. Investors declined to pay the premium.

**Key lesson:** Valuation premiums are earned through demonstrably superior fundamentals, not assumed. The market is skilled at identifying when a company is valued for what management hopes it will become, rather than what it has proven.

---

**3. Al Khaldi Logistics**

Cancellation reason: Failed to meet minimum threshold
Root cause: Insufficient differentiation in a crowded sector

2025 saw multiple logistics IPOs succeed - Tharwah raised SAR 372M and Khaldi Logistics raised SAR 75M. Al Khaldi Logistics could not articulate a compelling reason why investors should choose it over existing options.

The differentiation test is simple. When investors ask "why this company versus the other logistics IPO?", the answer must be specific: proprietary technology, exclusive routes, superior unit economics, or a customer base with demonstrably lower concentration and churn.

Al Khaldi's answer amounted to "we are also in logistics." In a year when logistics as a sector was well-represented in the IPO pipeline, that was not enough.

**Key lesson:** Crowded IPO markets require genuine differentiation. Sector momentum is a tailwind, not a substitute for a distinct competitive position.

---

**4. Dome (Construction Materials)**

Cancellation reason: Inadequate investor interest
Root cause: Sector timing - not company quality

```
Dome launch: Q3 2025
Construction sector PMI: 47.5 (in contraction)
Peer stock performance (year-to-date): -18% average
Sector sentiment: Negative
```

Dome launched into a sector-wide downturn driven by declining real estate permits, paused government infrastructure spending, and warnings from competitors. Investors were avoiding construction sector exposure broadly - nothing Dome could do at the company level would have overcome the sector headwind.

**Key lesson:** Sector timing can outweigh company quality. Even a well-run, properly priced company can fail to attract subscription if the entire industry is in an investor disfavour cycle. Building in flexibility to delay the launch by two to three months to monitor sector conditions is valuable.

---

**5. Rawabi (Industrial Services)**

Cancellation reason: Cancelled due to low demand
Root cause: Poor financial track record

Rawabi's prospectus disclosed a deteriorating financial trend:

```
Year 1: SAR 180M revenue, 15% EBITDA margin
Year 2: SAR 165M revenue, 12% EBITDA margin
Year 3: SAR 155M revenue, 9% EBITDA margin
```

Declining revenue, compressing margins, working capital challenges, and 60% revenue concentration in two customers - this is not the profile of an IPO-ready growth company.

IPO investors are underwriting future growth, not funding a turnaround. When the trend line points backward, they rationally decline to participate.

**Key lesson:** Fix operational problems before attempting an IPO. A company needs to demonstrate stability or growth before expecting capital markets to fund its recovery. Attempting to raise public equity to solve underlying business problems rarely ends well.

## Root Cause Analysis: What the Data Shows

Aggregating 2025 cancellations with historical data reveals consistent patterns.

### Primary Failure Factors

| Root Cause | Frequency | Prevention |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| Overpricing | 40% | Rigorous comparable analysis; apply 15–20% IPO discount to peer multiples |
| Weak equity story | 25% | Develop clear differentiation narrative 12 months pre-launch |
| Poor market timing | 20% | Monitor sector sentiment; build in 2–3 month flexibility |
| Inadequate track record | 10% | Build 3+ years of clean financials before attempting an IPO |
| Execution issues | 5% | Engage experienced advisors; begin preparation 18 months early |

### Secondary Contributing Factors

**Governance red flags:**
- Related-party transactions not conducted at arm's length
- Insufficient independent directors
- Undisclosed material legal disputes
- Audit qualifications or prior financial restatements

**Market structure issues:**
- Free float below the regulatory minimum
- Ownership too concentrated post-IPO
- Lock-up periods too short (under twelve months for founders)
- Significant insider selling at IPO (signals management's own assessment of fair value)

**Competitive positioning:**
- Late entrant in a saturated IPO pipeline for the same sector
- Multiple comparable deals in the same quarter creating direct subscription competition
- No clear competitive advantage - a "me-too" business in a trending sector

## Critical Thresholds: Minimum Viability Standards

The market has established clear coverage thresholds below which IPOs typically do not proceed.

### Institutional Coverage Requirements

**TASI:**
- Below 2x: High cancellation risk
- 2–3x: Marginal (may proceed with repricing)
- 5–10x: Solid (comfortable to proceed)
- 20x+: Exceptional (supports top-of-range pricing)

**Nomu:**
- Below 1.5x: Failure near-certain
- 1.5–3x: Marginal
- 10x+: Solid
- 50x+: Exceptional

### Retail Subscription Requirements

**TASI:** 100% minimum retail tranche subscription. Below this, institutional compensation must be dramatic and explicit.

**Nomu:** 80% minimum retail tranche subscription. Institutions can partially compensate, but a combined total below 1.5x remains a cancellation threshold.

**Critical principle:** Retail undersubscription is more tolerable when institutional demand significantly overcompensates. If both tranches fail, cancellation is effectively inevitable.

### Minimum Viable Offering Size

**TASI:** SAR 200M minimum. Below this, listing fees, advisory costs, and underwriter compensation consume too large a share of proceeds. All-in costs at 4% on a SAR 150M offering consume SAR 6M and consume management capacity equivalent to a deal ten times the size.

**Nomu:** SAR 30M minimum. The smallest economical 2025 Nomu listing was SAR 50M (RATIO). Nomu average in 2025 was SAR 53M. Offerings below SAR 30M are rarely worth the effort relative to alternative funding paths.

## Applied Example: Using the Framework

**Company profile:** SAR 320M revenue industrial manufacturer on Nomu, targeting SAR 75M raise at SAR 375M implied market cap.

**Financial readiness: 23/30 (Moderate)**
- 3 years clean audits: strong
- Profitability: consistent but margins flat
- Growth: 12% CAGR (below the 15% target for full marks)
- Gap: No demonstrated margin expansion or growth acceleration

**Market positioning: 16/25 (Moderate)**
- Valuation at 10x EBITDA versus 11x peer average: adequate discount
- Differentiation: comparable to competitors - the Al Khaldi Logistics risk is present
- Sector: industrials, neutral in current conditions
- Gap: Weak differentiation narrative needs development

**Execution readiness: 21/25 (Strong)**
- All governance and preparation boxes checked: well-prepared operationally

**Market conditions: 11/20 (Moderate)**
- Nomu index flat; mixed recent IPO performance; Q2 launch planned
- Gap: conditions not ideal; flexible timing would help

**Total: 71/100 - Moderate risk, 70–80% estimated success probability**

**Suggested improvements:**
1. Develop a specific differentiation narrative - identify one credible "why us" advantage versus sector peers
2. Demonstrate growth trajectory - announce a contract win, capacity expansion, or product launch that supports a path to 15%+ growth
3. Time the launch to coincide with better Nomu index momentum (wait for +5% index move before applying)

With these improvements: estimated score 83–86/100, moving into the low-risk category.

## Key Takeaways

1. **2025 failure rate:** Six cancellations - one TASI, five Nomu - representing approximately 14% of Nomu attempts
2. **Primary causes:** Overpricing (40%), weak equity story (25%), poor timing (20%), inadequate track record (10%)
3. **Both tranches must work:** The Alwazn case is definitive - 450x institutional oversubscription could not offset retail undersubscription below the threshold
4. **Valuation premiums require evidence:** Lavenco's 64% premium to peers without supporting fundamentals was rejected efficiently
5. **Sector timing can override company quality:** Dome failed because the construction sector was in active disfavour, not because the company was poorly run
6. **Capital markets do not fund turnarounds:** Rawabi's declining revenue and margin trend made investor participation rational to decline
7. **Minimum viable sizes:** SAR 200M on TASI, SAR 30M on Nomu - below these, economics do not work
8. **Pre-IPO risk framework:** Score your situation honestly across financial readiness, market positioning, execution, and market conditions before committing to a timeline
9. **Properly prepared (85+ score): 85–90% success probability. Rushed or underqualified: below 65%.**
