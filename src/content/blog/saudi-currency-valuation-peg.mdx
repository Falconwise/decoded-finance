{/* IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: A clean diagram showing two parallel valuation paths — SAR model vs USD model — with arrows showing consistent inputs on each side and a conversion bridge between them */}

Currency assumptions can quietly break an otherwise clean valuation. For Saudi companies, the SAR peg provides a stable modeling anchor for most corporate valuation work — but the key requirement is internal consistency, not just familiarity.

This post provides a practical framework. It does not offer predictions about exchange rates or policy.

## The Peg as a Modeling Anchor

For standard corporate valuation work, treat the SAR/USD peg as a stable base-case assumption. Deviation from this should be reserved for cases where there is a specific, documented reason to do otherwise — not as a reflexive caution flag.

---

## Inflation Consistency Rule

If you model in SAR:
- Terminal growth should be consistent with **SAR inflation** and real growth assumptions
- Do not mix a USD risk-free rate with a SAR terminal growth narrative without making the conversion explicit

If you model in USD:
- Terminal growth should be **USD-consistent**
- Discount rates must be USD-denominated

The rule is simple: pick one currency for the model and make every input consistent with it.

## Valuing in USD vs SAR

Both are defensible. What is not defensible is mixing:

| Model Currency | Discount Rate | Terminal Growth | Final Output |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|
| SAR | SAR-based WACC | SAR-consistent g | SAR equity value |
| USD | USD-based WACC | USD-consistent g | USD equity value, then translate |

If you translate a SAR model into USD at the end, the translation should use a consistent exchange rate assumption — typically the spot rate, with sensitivity.

## Tail-Risk Stress Test (Not a Forecast)

A useful governance step is to run a stress scenario to understand downside sensitivity. This is not a prediction — it is a test of model resilience.

Typical stress parameters:
- WACC higher by 100–150 basis points
- Credit spreads wider
- ERP elevated
- Margins under pressure (relevant for import-cost-sensitive businesses)
- Working capital deterioration

Present this as a named stress case, without attaching probability or timing. The purpose is to understand how much the valuation changes under plausible adverse conditions.

---

## Forward Points

Foreign exchange forward points reflect interest rate differentials and funding conditions between two currencies. They can inform near-term translation assumptions in multi-currency models — but they should not drive long-term terminal value assumptions. That is a category error.
