Here is a question that many CFOs encounter during listing discussions: **how much does venue choice actually affect company valuation?**

The answer, based on market data from Saudi Arabia's dual-market system, is material: companies listing on Nomu trade at a **persistent 15–35% valuation discount** compared to equivalent companies on TASI, even when controlling for sector, size, growth rates, and profitability. This is not a temporary anomaly that arbitrage eliminates — it is a structural market feature embedded in liquidity dynamics, investor access, and market perception.

In this piece we quantify the valuation gap, examine the mechanics driving it, review real transfer cases, and outline what companies can do to optimise their positioning.

## The Core Finding: Quantifying the Valuation Gap

### Market Structure Comparison

| Metric | TASI | Nomu | Impact |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Average daily volume | SAR 12–45M | SAR 0.8–3M | 15–30x difference |
| Bid-ask spread | 0.2–0.5% | 1.0–3.0% | 5x wider on Nomu |
| Free float requirement | 30% minimum | 20% minimum | 1.5x more liquid on TASI |
| Price discovery | Continuous | Episodic | TASI more efficient |
| Foreign ownership | 4.87% (SAR 466B) | 1.49% (SAR 0.6B) | 3.3x higher on TASI |

### Valuation Multiple Premium by Sector (TASI Over Nomu)

**Technology:**
- P/E premium: 15–20%
- EV/EBITDA premium: 12–18%
- Context: High-growth narratives are less liquidity-dependent; institutional investors are comfortable with tech risk

**Healthcare:**
- P/E premium: 20–25%
- EV/EBITDA premium: 18–23%
- Context: Defensive characteristics are valued across investor types; TASI retail participation adds a further demand layer

**Industrial:**
- P/E premium: 25–35%
- EV/EBITDA premium: 22–30%
- Context: Capital-intensive businesses require deep investor pools; cyclical trading patterns demand exit liquidity

**Consumer Goods:**
- P/E premium: 18–24%
- EV/EBITDA premium: 15–22%
- Context: Brand recognition drives retail demand on TASI; Nomu pre-listing is limited to institutional investors

The discount is not uniform — it varies by how much a sector depends on broad liquidity, retail participation, and institutional depth.

---

## The Liquidity Discount: Mechanics and Evidence

Liquidity affects valuation through several distinct channels.

### Pre-Listing Investor Restrictions

Nomu shares are tradeable only by qualified investors until listing is complete. In Saudi Arabia, the qualified investor threshold is set at SAR 40M or more in securities holdings (or equivalent professional qualifications), which effectively excludes the majority of retail participants during the IPO period.

This creates a structural demand constraint versus TASI, where universal access begins from the opening bell. Academic and practitioner literature on liquidity discounts typically estimates this constraint at 10–20% of fair value, depending on the sector and the depth of qualified investor demand.

### Post-Listing Liquidity Dynamics

Even after listing, Nomu faces persistent structural liquidity challenges:

- **Trading volume:** SAR 0.8–3M daily (mid-cap comparison) versus SAR 12–45M on TASI — a 15–30x gap
- **Bid-ask spreads:** 1–3% on Nomu versus 0.2–0.5% on TASI, meaning higher transaction costs for every trade
- **Price discovery:** Continuous price formation on TASI versus episodic on Nomu — information asymmetry is priced into Nomu multiples

These factors compound. Institutional investors need confidence in their ability to exit positions at reasonable cost. When that confidence is absent, they apply a liquidity risk premium — typically expressed as 2–4 P/E multiple points of discount.

## The 2025 Stress Test: When Liquidity Matters Most

Market downturns reveal the real cost of illiquidity. 2025 provided a clear natural experiment.

### Performance Divergence (January–December 2025)

| Metric | TASI | Nomu |
|--------|------|------|
| Index return | -6.8% | -26% |
| IPO cohort 6-month performance | +4.2% average | -15% average |
| Trading above offer (6 months) | 65% | 42% |

Nomu performed **3.8 times worse** than TASI during the same period. Why?

**Liquidity flight:** In risk-off environments, illiquid names are sold first — lower free float means larger price impact per trade, creating a downward feedback loop.

**Retail concentration:** Individual investors held approximately SAR 28.3B of Nomu securities (roughly 70% of market cap). Retail selling in illiquid conditions produces outsized price declines with no institutional floor to absorb them.

**No passive support:** Nomu is excluded from major indices (MSCI, FTSE), so there is no passive buying pressure during drawdowns.

**Information gap:** Thinner analyst coverage on Nomu widens valuation uncertainty during stress, and investors apply more conservative scenarios.

## Case Study: The Nofoth Valuation Situation

Nofoth Food Products' transfer from Nomu to TASI in January 2026 provides a useful illustration of how venue change can affect the structural context for a company's valuation.

### Nomu Background (January 2023 – December 2025)

- **IPO date:** 10 January 2023
- **IPO price:** SAR 150/share (pre-split)
- **Adjusted IPO price:** SAR 15/share (after 10:1 stock split, June 2023)
- **Initial market cap:** SAR 360M

**Corporate actions during Nomu period:**
- June 2023: 10:1 stock split
- January 2024: Bonus share issuance (capital increased SAR 24M → SAR 48M)
- June 2025: Further bonus share issuance (capital SAR 48M → SAR 96M)

**Final Nomu position:**
- Last closing price on Nomu: SAR 9.79 (31 December 2025)
- Return from adjusted IPO price: -35%
- Market cap at transfer: approximately SAR 940M (96M shares × SAR 9.79)

Despite business growth — evidenced by the capital increases — shareholders experienced a negative return during the Nomu period, reflecting the combination of share dilution from bonus issuances, the -26% Nomu index decline in 2025, and the structural liquidity discount.

### Transfer to TASI (21 January 2026)

- Transfer approved: 31 December 2025
- Opening TASI price: SAR 9.79 (carried over from Nomu)
- Market cap at transfer: approximately SAR 940M
- Sector: Food & Beverages (TASI classification)
- Investor base: Universal access

### Structural Re-Rating Factors

The transfer to TASI changes several structural conditions:

**Liquidity expansion:** TASI average daily volume is typically 10–30 times Nomu levels for comparable companies. Tighter spreads reduce transaction costs and improve institutional exit confidence.

**Broader investor access:** The TASI listing opens participation to retail investors, consumer brand followers, and (post-February 2026) direct foreign institutional access — all of which were structurally limited or absent on Nomu.

**Index inclusion potential:** TASI-listed companies are eligible for FTSE Russell and MSCI emerging market indices; passive inflows from index-tracking funds represent a new, non-sentiment-driven demand layer.

**Peer comparison shift:** On TASI, Nofoth is compared against established food companies such as Almarai (P/E approximately 15x historically) and Savola (P/E approximately 13x historically) — providing a valuation anchor that simply did not exist among Nomu-listed food peers.

Based on these structural changes, analysts following the company cited an **estimated 12-month valuation range of SAR 13–16** — implying a structural re-rating of 33–63% from the SAR 9.79 transfer price. This range represents an analytical estimate based on applying TASI food sector multiples; it is not a guaranteed outcome. Market conditions, earnings delivery, and sector sentiment will all influence actual trading.

### Counterfactual: What if Nofoth Had Listed on TASI Directly?

For context — not as a recommendation — analysts estimated that a direct TASI listing in January 2023 at the same fundamentals might have priced around SAR 18/share (post-split equivalent), reflecting a 20% TASI venue premium relative to the adjusted Nomu IPO price. The key insight is not that one path was right and the other wrong, but that the structural discount on Nomu is persistent and documented.

## Historical Transfer Performance: The 21-Company Dataset

Nofoth is not an isolated case. Twenty-one companies have transferred from Nomu to TASI as of January 2026.

### Aggregate Cohort Analysis

**Early transfers (2019–2020): 8 companies**
- Average time on Nomu before transfer: 2–3 years
- Post-transfer 6-month returns: +18% average vs. TASI index
- Market context: Pre-COVID growth environment

**Mid-period transfers (2021–2023): 5 companies**
- Notable: Canadian Medical Center, Gaz Arabian Services
- Post-transfer 6-month returns: +12% average
- Market context: Pandemic recovery and rate hike period

**Recent transfers (2024–2026): 8 companies**
- Notable: Saudi Azm, Obeikan Glass (July 2025), Nofoth, Alwasail (January 2026)
- Saudi Azm post-transfer 6-month return: +25%
- Post-transfer tracking ongoing for the 2026 cohort

### Decomposing the +15–22% Gain

**Liquidity premium (10–15% of the total gain):**
Tighter spreads reduce transaction costs; higher volumes improve price discovery; institutional confidence in exit ability improves.

**Investor base expansion (5–8% of the total gain):**
Retail access adds a new demand layer; foreign investors gain direct entry (particularly post-February 2026); passive index funds begin allocating.

**Reduced information asymmetry (2–4% of the total gain):**
More analyst coverage on TASI names; greater media visibility; enhanced governance signalling.

**What drives larger re-ratings (+20–30%):**
Consumer-facing brands with retail investor appeal; companies with strong fundamentals that were structurally undervalued due to Nomu's limited investor pool; transfers timed with positive earnings surprises; sectors with high-multiple TASI comparables.

**What drives smaller re-ratings (+8–15%):**
Industrial B2B companies with limited retail appeal; transfers during market downturns; sectors already well-represented on Nomu; companies with execution challenges post-transfer.

## Market Cap Threshold Effects

The valuation discount is not linear. It intensifies as companies grow past certain thresholds while remaining on Nomu.

| Market Cap Range | Estimated Valuation Discount | Dynamic |
|-----------------|------------------------------|---------|
| SAR 50–100M | 15–18% | Appropriate for size; investors accept Nomu |
| SAR 100–200M | 18–22% | Moderate; growing investor questions |
| SAR 200–300M | 22–28% | Investors begin asking about transfer timeline |
| SAR 300–500M | 28–35% | Why hasn't this company graduated? |
| SAR 500M+ | 35%+ | "Stuck on Nomu" perception actively hurts multiples |

Companies exceeding SAR 300M market cap that remain on Nomu face a signalling problem — the market starts interpreting the lack of graduation as evidence of governance concerns, management complacency, or undisclosed issues. This perception adds 5–10 percentage points to the structural liquidity discount.

**Optimal Nomu timing:** The regulatory minimum is 2 years. The empirically optimal window is 2.5–3 years. Beyond 4 years, the discount begins to widen meaningfully from "stuck" perception.

---

## Sector-Specific Valuation Differentials

### Technology: Smallest Discount (15–20%)

High-growth narratives are less dependent on current liquidity; institutional investors who dominate Nomu's pre-listing period are comfortable with technology risk; network effects and scalability reduce liquidity concerns. Jahez maintained a strong valuation despite its Nomu listing (SAR 1.6B IPO, 2021).

Technology companies with strong growth stories can generally tolerate the Nomu period without severe valuation damage.

### Healthcare: Moderate Discount (20–25%)

Defensive sector characteristics are valued across investor types; recurring revenue models provide predictability; but retail appeal is significant for hospital chains, where TASI-listed names like Sulaiman Al Habib and Fakeeh Care trade at meaningful premiums driven partly by retail familiarity.

Healthcare companies with consumer-facing brands benefit from early TASI access; B2B medical suppliers can reasonably begin on Nomu.

### Industrial: Largest Discount (25–35%)

Capital-intensive sectors require deep investor pools; retail investors (structurally absent from Nomu's pre-listing phase) often drive industrial stock demand; cyclical trading patterns demand liquidity for timing; limited growth narratives compress multiples further.

Industrial companies benefit most from prioritising a direct TASI route where the market cap supports it.

### Consumer Goods: Moderate-High Discount (18–24%)

Brand recognition creates retail investor appeal that TASI captures more effectively; institutional investors understand consumer business models well; e-commerce and direct-to-consumer platforms carry more technology-like qualities that reduce the discount; traditional retail with heavy assets faces the higher end of the range.

## The February 2026 Foreign Access Catalyst

The 1 February 2026 market liberalisation permanently altered the TASI/Nomu valuation equation.

Prior to this date, foreign investors accessed TASI via Qualified Foreign Investor (QFI) licences — a complex intermediation that embedded an estimated 2–3% access-friction discount in TASI multiples. The new regime removes this friction entirely, allowing direct foreign investor access to TASI with no QFI requirement.

**Nomu is unchanged:** Qualified investor restrictions remain in place, and the new rules apply only to TASI.

**The widening gap:**

| | Pre-February 2026 | Post-February 2026 |
|--|--|--|
| TASI/Nomu premium | 17–27% | 20–32% |
| Investor base advantage | 5–8% | 8–13% |

For companies targeting international institutional capital, TASI is now decisively more advantageous. The gap between TASI and Nomu on the foreign access dimension has widened — and the change is structural, not cyclical.

## The Stepping-Stone Strategy: Financial Modelling

For companies with **SAR 150–400M market cap**, the Nomu-first approach can, under the right conditions, maximise total value captured over a 3–5 year horizon.

### Scenario Comparison: Direct TASI vs Nomu → TASI

**Scenario A: Direct TASI Listing**

Company profile: SAR 300M market cap, needs capital for expansion.

- TASI IPO (30% float): Raise SAR 90M at SAR 300M valuation
- All-in costs (3.5%): SAR 3.15M
- Net proceeds: SAR 86.85M
- Ongoing TASI compliance: SAR 2–3M annually
- Total net capital over 4 years (after SAR 10M compliance): **SAR 76.85M**

**Scenario B: Nomu → TASI Stepping Stone**

Year 1 — Nomu IPO:
- List at SAR 200M market cap (reflecting Nomu structural discount)
- Float: 20% — Raise SAR 40M
- All-in costs (6%): SAR 2.4M
- Net proceeds: SAR 37.6M
- Ongoing Nomu compliance: SAR 0.8–1.2M annually

Years 2–3 — Growth on Nomu:
- Execute growth plan, target SAR 400M market cap by Year 3
- Total 2-year compliance: SAR 2M

Year 3 — Transfer to TASI:
- Market cap before transfer: SAR 400M
- Transfer costs: SAR 0.8M
- Structural re-rating: +18% (based on historical averages)
- Post-transfer market cap: approximately SAR 472M

Year 4 — Secondary Offering on TASI:
- 10% additional float at post-transfer valuation
- Offer size: SAR 47.2M
- Net proceeds: SAR 45.8M (after ~3% costs)

Total net capital over 4 years (after all costs): **SAR 80.6M**

| Metric | Scenario A | Scenario B | Difference |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Total net capital raised | SAR 76.85M | SAR 80.6M | +SAR 3.75M |
| 4-year compliance costs | SAR 10M | SAR 3.8M | Save SAR 6.2M |
| Founder wealth at Year 4 | 70% × SAR 300M | 70% × SAR 472M | +SAR 120M |

The stepping-stone advantage is not primarily in capital raised — it is in valuation. By growing through the Nomu period with lighter governance costs and then capturing the transfer re-rating, the founder's economic position improves materially.

### When This Strategy Works Best

The stepping-stone path makes sense when:
- Market cap is SAR 150–400M (below comfortable TASI entry but viable for Nomu)
- Initial capital need is below SAR 100M (manageable with Nomu's 20% float)
- A credible 3–5 year growth trajectory exists to reach the SAR 200M+ threshold for transfer
- Management prefers lighter initial compliance burden
- The sector has established TASI comparables to benchmark against post-transfer
- Foreign investor access is not time-critical from day one

Direct TASI is the better path when:
- Market cap exceeds SAR 500M (clear TASI qualification with buffer)
- Immediate capital need exceeds SAR 300M (Nomu cannot absorb this scale)
- The company has strong consumer brand recognition (TASI premium is immediate and large)
- Foreign investor access is strategically important from the outset
- The industry demands maximum immediate credibility (banking, insurance, established healthcare)

## Tactical Considerations for Nomu-Listed Companies

**Pre-IPO (Nomu launch):**
- Consider disclosing in the prospectus that the company intends to pursue TASI graduation within a defined timeframe — this signals ambition and partially offsets the Nomu discount
- Adopt TASI governance standards from day one (33%+ independent directors, quarterly disclosure) — this allows the company to trade at a "TASI optionality" premium above the Nomu floor

**During the Nomu period:**
- Build analyst coverage proactively — even semi-annual earnings calls reduce information asymmetry
- Maintain a 25–30% free float target (above the 20% Nomu minimum) to improve liquidity
- Zero CMA violations — a clean regulatory record smooths the transfer process

**Transfer preparation:**
- Pre-announce transfer intentions publicly well ahead of the formal application (typically at the 18–22 month mark)
- Align the announcement with a strong earnings period when possible
- Engage institutional investors ahead of the migration — pre-transfer meetings help build the TASI demand base before trading begins

## Key Takeaways

1. **The gap is structural, not cyclical:** 15–35% valuation discount between TASI and comparable Nomu peers, driven by liquidity, investor base, and information asymmetry
2. **Sector matters significantly:** Industrial companies face the largest penalty (25–35%); technology the smallest (15–20%)
3. **2025 validated the risk:** Nomu fell 3.8x worse than TASI during market stress (-26% vs -6.8%)
4. **Graduation delivers:** 21 historical transfers averaged 15–22% valuation uplift within 6–12 months
5. **February 2026 widens the gap:** Foreign access on TASI — with Nomu unchanged — adds an estimated 3–5 percentage points to the structural premium
6. **Threshold risk:** Companies above SAR 300M remaining on Nomu face a "stuck" perception that adds 5–10 points to the existing discount
7. **The stepping-stone works in the right context:** For SAR 150–400M companies with the right profile, Nomu → TASI creates value through compliance savings, execution flexibility, and the transfer re-rating
