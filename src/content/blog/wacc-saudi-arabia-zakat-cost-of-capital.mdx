{/* IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: A clean diagram showing the WACC formula components — equity weight, cost of equity, debt weight, cost of debt — in a Saudi market context */}

Saudi valuations often go wrong for one simple reason. Analysts import a textbook WACC and apply it to SAR cash flows without adjusting for local mechanics.

This post lays out a practical, audit-friendly WACC workflow for Saudi companies. The goal is not a single perfect number — it's a WACC that is internally consistent, explainable to a CFO, and easy to sensitize.

## The Core Definition

Weighted Average Cost of Capital is the blended required return demanded by all capital providers:

**WACC = (w_e × K_e) + (w_d × K_d)**

Where:
- **w_e**, **w_d** are market value weights of equity and debt
- **K_e** is cost of equity
- **K_d** is cost of debt — after-tax only when a genuine tax shield exists

## Step-by-Step WACC Workflow for Saudi Companies

### Step A — Pick the valuation currency first

If your cash flows are in SAR, every WACC input must be SAR-consistent:
- Risk-free rate must be SAR-based
- Country risk adjustments must not be double-counted
- Inflation and growth assumptions should match the currency

If you are valuing in USD, that is also defensible — but then cash flows, discount rate, and terminal growth must all be USD-consistent. Do not mix the two.

### Step B — Estimate the SAR risk-free rate

Two defensible approaches:

1. **Direct SAR government yield** — use a long-tenor SAR government bond yield when a reliable, liquid benchmark is available.
2. **Peg-consistent build-up** — start with a USD risk-free rate and add a Saudi sovereign spread proxy:

**R_f(SAR) = R_f(USD) + CDS(KSA)**

Use the same tenor for both components. Label inputs as illustrative if you are not using a live market feed.

### Step C — Build cost of equity using CAPM, then sanity-check it

Baseline CAPM:

**K_e = R_f + (β × ERP)**

Document clearly:
- Risk-free rate source and tenor
- Beta method (regression beta, adjusted beta, or bottom-up beta)
- ERP construction — global base, plus any country risk component if used

**Useful cross-checks:**
- Compare K_e to a dividend yield plus a conservative long-run growth rate (a pricing check, not a replacement for CAPM)
- Compare K_e to a reasonable range for the sector and company size, and explain any drivers of divergence

### Step D — Estimate cost of debt from observable pricing or a synthetic rating

Two approaches:
1. **Observable pricing** — use latest facility pricing, sukuk yield, or spreads over SAIBOR
2. **Synthetic rating** — map financial ratios to a rating band, then apply a spread range

Keep K_d as the current **marginal** borrowing rate, not the historical average cost.

### Step E — Handle Zakat vs tax consistently

This is where Saudi WACC models most often break.

If the company is primarily a Zakat payer, interest expense typically does not create the same corporate income tax shield that the textbook formula assumes. Applying K_d × (1 − t) in that case understates WACC.

**Practical defaults:**
- Income tax payer → use after-tax cost of debt: K_d × (1 − t)
- Zakat payer → use pre-tax cost of debt as a conservative default, unless a specific tax shield mechanism is clearly documented
- Mixed structure → apply a weighted approach consistent with the entity's actual tax position

### Step F — Use market value weights, and document all approximations

- **w_e = E / (D + E)**, where E is market cap (or a defensible private valuation proxy)
- **w_d = D / (D + E)**, where D is the market value of interest-bearing debt (book value is often a reasonable approximation when close to par)

## Worked Example (Illustrative Numbers Only)

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| SAR risk-free rate | 5.5% |
| Equity risk premium | 6.0% |
| Beta | 1.1 |
| Marginal cost of debt | 7.0% |
| Equity (market cap) | SAR 1,000M |
| Debt (book approx.) | SAR 500M |

**Cost of equity:**
K_e = 5.5% + (1.1 × 6.0%) = **12.1%**

**Weights:**
w_e = 1,000 / 1,500 = 66.7% &nbsp;|&nbsp; w_d = 500 / 1,500 = 33.3%

**WACC — Zakat payer (no conventional tax shield):**
WACC = (0.667 × 12.1%) + (0.333 × 7.0%) = **10.4%**

**WACC — income tax payer at t = 20%:**
WACC = (0.667 × 12.1%) + (0.333 × 7.0% × 0.80) = **9.9%**

The point is not the decimal places. The point is to show clearly why the tax treatment assumption matters and to make it explicit in every model.

## Integrity Checklist Before You Publish a Number

1. **Currency consistency** — SAR cash flows and SAR risk-free rate are matched
2. **No double counting** — if country risk is in ERP, it should not also appear elsewhere
3. **Debt pricing realism** — K_d reflects current marginal cost, not last year's average
4. **Tax treatment stated plainly** — one sentence in the assumption box is sufficient
5. **Sensitivity table included** — WACC ± 0.5% and ± 1.0%, with valuation impact shown
