The IPO is not the finish line. It is the starting gun.

After months of preparation, roadshows, and book-building, the listing bell rings. Then reality sets in: will the stock trade up, down, or sideways? And more importantly - what actually determines long-term aftermarket success?

The data from Saudi Arabia's 2024–2025 IPO cohorts reveals clear patterns worth understanding regardless of your perspective - whether you are a CFO planning a listing, a financial officer managing investor relations, or a market observer studying capital markets structure.

**TASI Performance (2024–2025):**
- Average first-day return: +8.5%
- Six-month performance: +4.2% (versus TASI index -6.8% in the same period)
- Trading above offer price at six months: 65% of cohort

**Nomu Performance (2024–2025):**
- Average first-day return: +12.3%
- Six-month performance: -15% average
- Trading above offer price at six months: 42% of cohort

The 19-percentage-point performance gap between TASI and Nomu six-month returns is not primarily a function of company quality. It reflects market structure - liquidity, investor composition, and the presence (or absence) of institutional support during stress.

## First-Day Returns: The Underpricing Phenomenon

### What Is IPO Underpricing?

**Definition:** The percentage return from the offer price to the first-day closing price.

**Formula:** `First-Day Return = (Day 1 Close − Offer Price) ÷ Offer Price × 100%`

**Example:** Offer price SAR 50, Day 1 close SAR 54.25 → first-day return = +8.5%

**Why underpricing occurs:**
1. Asymmetric information - issuers know the business better than investors, who apply a discovery discount
2. Risk management - underwriters intentionally leave some room for a first-day gain to ensure successful subscription
3. Aftermarket momentum - a positive first day reinforces buying interest in subsequent sessions
4. Investor compensation - first-day gains partly compensate for the information asymmetry and lock-up periods

### Saudi Arabia First-Day Data (2024–2025)

**TASI:**
- Average: +8.5% | Median: +5.2%
- Range: -2% to +30%
- Distribution: 35% of IPOs returned 0–5% (efficient pricing); 40% returned 5–10% (moderate underpricing); 18% returned 10–20% (significant); 7% returned 20%+ (excessive)

**Nomu:**
- Average: +12.3% | Median: +9.8%
- Range: -5% to +45%
- Distribution: 25% returned 0–5%; 30% returned 5–10%; 30% returned 10–20%; 15% returned 20%+

Nomu shows higher average underpricing and wider variance - reflecting less efficient price discovery in a smaller, less liquid market with more uncertainty around company fundamentals.

---

### First-Day Extremes: What They Signal

**Massive first-day gains (30%+):**
- Company priced conservatively - sometimes at bottom of range
- Unexpected positive news during the subscription period
- Extreme oversubscription (200x+)
- **Signal:** Significant underpricing. The company could have raised materially more capital at a higher price and still achieved full subscription.
- Winner: First-day investors. Loser: The company (foregone proceeds) and any selling shareholders.

**Negative first days (-2% to -5%):**
- Company priced aggressively at top of range
- Market conditions deteriorated between pricing and listing
- Insufficient aftermarket buying interest
- **Signal:** Overpricing. Retail investors are immediately underwater; selling pressure from day one.
- Winner: No one. Bad signals for all stakeholders.

**The "Goldilocks" range (5–10%):**
- Company maximised capital raised at a defensible price
- Left modest upside for investors (goodwill and momentum)
- Institutional aftermarket support is present
- **Signal:** Efficient pricing - demand exceeded supply at a price that was close to the ceiling
- **2025 Saudi examples:** Fakeeh Care (+6.5%), Saudi Parts Store (+7.2%), Al Baha Investment (+5.8%)

## Six-Month Aftermarket: The Reality Check

First-day returns generate headlines. Six-month performance determines whether the IPO was genuinely successful for all stakeholders.

### TASI 2025 Cohort

- Average return (offer to six months): **+4.2%**
- TASI index same period: **-6.8%**
- Outperformance versus index: +11 percentage points
- Trading above offer: **65%** of cohort

**Top performers:**
- Flynas: +22% (SAR 50 → SAR 61)
- Fakeeh Care: +18% (SAR 58 → SAR 68.44)
- Saudi Parts Store: +15% (SAR 65 → SAR 74.75)

**Underperformers:**
- Medgulf: -8% (insurance sector headwinds)
- Alramz: -5% (intensifying retail competition)

**Key observation:** TASI IPOs showed remarkable resilience during a year when the index itself fell 6.8%. The 65% success rate above offer - and the 11-point outperformance versus the index - reflects the quality selection effect of TASI's higher listing standards.

---

### Nomu 2024–2025 Cohort

- Average return (offer to six months): **-15%**
- Nomu index 2025: **-26%**
- Outperformance versus index: +11 percentage points (same index-relative outperformance as TASI)
- Trading above offer: **42%** of cohort

**Top performers:**
- Khaldi Logistics: +18% (strong execution and sector momentum)
- Arabica Star: +12%
- RATIO: +8%

**Underperformers:**
- Alwazn Almithaly: -35% (post-IPO margin compression)
- Lavenco: -28% (relaunched at lower valuation after initial cancellation)

**Key observation:** Nomu's -15% average is contextually better than it appears - the index fell 26%. But in absolute terms, 58% of cohort companies trading below offer at six months reflects both the market stress and structural liquidity constraints.

## The 19-Point TASI/Nomu Performance Gap: Root Causes

**TASI six-month average:** +4.2%
**Nomu six-month average:** -15%
**Gap:** 19 percentage points

This divergence is structural. The same underlying market stress (Saudi equities under pressure in 2025) hit the two markets very differently.

### Root Cause 1: Liquidity During Stress

In risk-off environments, the least liquid names are sold first.

**TASI protection factors:**
- Daily volume SAR 12–45M per stock (institutional support can absorb selling)
- Tight bid-ask spreads (0.2–0.5%) - lower exit cost
- Passive index inflows (FTSE, MSCI) buying regardless of sentiment
- 4.87% foreign investor participation providing a stabilising demand base

**Nomu vulnerability factors:**
- Daily volume SAR 0.8–3M per stock - forced selling has outsized price impact
- Wide bid-ask spreads (1–3%) - exit is costly and often delayed
- No passive index inflows (Nomu excluded from major indices)
- 1.49% foreign ownership - almost entirely domestic, sentiment-driven

**Result:** The same selling pressure hit Nomu prices 3.8x harder (-26% vs -6.8% index returns).

### Root Cause 2: Issuer Quality Filter

TASI's higher listing standards act as a quality filter.

| Requirement | TASI | Nomu |
|-------------|------|------|
| Minimum market cap | SAR 300M | SAR 10M |
| Audited financials required | 3+ years | 2 years |
| Profitability requirement | Required | Not mandatory |
| Board independence | 33% minimum | Lighter requirements |
| Free float | 30% | 20% |

Higher standards produce a higher base rate of quality issuers. This filters through into aftermarket outcomes: 65% above offer on TASI versus 42% on Nomu.

### Root Cause 3: Institutional Support Quality

**TASI IPOs:** 70% institutional allocation; lock-ups typically 12–24 months; active analyst coverage from day one; underwriter aftermarket support economically justified.

**Nomu IPOs:** Smaller institutional base; shorter lock-ups; limited analyst coverage (smaller market caps); minimal aftermarket underwriter engagement (too small to justify).

**Result:** TASI stocks have stronger institutional holders that absorb volatility. Nomu stocks face retail-dominated aftermarkets where selling pressure concentrates in months 2–4.

## What Separates Aftermarket Winners from Losers

### Winners (six-month returns above 15%)

**Characteristic 1: Beat earnings expectations**

The first post-IPO quarterly results are the most important single event for aftermarket performance. Companies that beat prospectus guidance by 20–30% re-rate sharply upward as credibility is established.

- **Flynas (+22%):** Q1 2025 EBITDA of SAR 185M versus SAR 165M guidance; load factor 88% versus 84% guided
- **Fakeeh Care (+18%):** Healthcare sector momentum +8% in same period; government medical tourism initiative announcement
- **Saudi Parts Store (+15%):** E-commerce launch announcement; 20 new location plan revealed

**Characteristic 2: Sector momentum**

Listings in sectors experiencing positive news flow - government support announcements, peer outperformance, regulatory tailwinds - benefit from a rising tide. Conversely, sector headwinds create drag regardless of company quality.

**Characteristic 3: Strategic post-IPO actions**

M&A announcements, international partnerships, new product launches, and expansion plans - when they are credible and align with the IPO narrative - reinforce the growth story and support valuation.

**Characteristic 4: Strong liquidity profile**

Stocks trading SAR 15M+ daily retain institutional interest and tight bid-ask spreads. Liquidity collapse (below SAR 2M daily) creates a negative feedback loop regardless of fundamentals.

---

### Losers (six-month returns below -15%)

**Characteristic 1: Earnings disappointment**

Missing the first post-IPO quarter - the one investors use to calibrate whether management's projections can be trusted - typically causes a valuation reset that takes multiple subsequent beats to recover.

- **Alwazn Almithaly (-35%):** EBITDA of SAR 12M versus SAR 18M guidance; credibility destroyed

**Characteristic 2: Overpricing at launch**

Companies that priced at a premium to peers with no justifying fundamental advantage faced immediate post-IPO selling. Retail investors who subscribed expecting a first-day gain became sellers when it did not materialise, creating sustained downward pressure.

**Pattern:**
- Offer P/E: 18x (versus peers at 14–15x)
- Day 1: -3% (immediate signal that demand was insufficient at the price)
- Months 1–3: Continued retail exit
- Month 6: -25% (multiple compressed to peer level)

**Characteristic 3: Sector headwinds**

- **Medgulf (-8%):** Insurance sector broadly underperformed due to rate competition and regulatory pricing changes. The company's decline reflected sector rotation, not company-specific failure.

**Characteristic 4: Liquidity collapse**

Once daily volume falls below SAR 2M, bid-ask spreads widen, institutional support withdraws (uneconomical to support), and trapped retail investors cannot exit without additional price impact. This dynamic compounds over months.

## Underpricing vs Overpricing: The Right Balance

### The Underpricing Cost-Benefit

**Scenario: SAR 1B IPO with 20% first-day return**

The company offered at SAR 50; stock closes at SAR 60.

**Capital foregone:**
If priced at SAR 60 (where demand proved it could clear), the company would have raised SAR 1.2B instead of SAR 1B - SAR 200M in unrealised proceeds.

**What underpricing delivers in return:**
- Aftermarket momentum - strong first day creates sustained buying interest
- Media coverage - positive headlines attract retail participation
- Employee morale - stock options are immediately in-the-money
- Future access - a successful IPO makes follow-on capital markets access easier

**Net assessment:**
- Underpricing below 10%: acceptable cost for a strong market entry
- Underpricing 10–15%: borderline - meaningful capital foregone
- Underpricing above 15%: excessive - pricing execution should have been sharper

### The Overpricing Problem

**Scenario: SAR 500M IPO with -5% first-day return**

Retail investors are immediately underwater. The cascade that follows is well-documented in Saudi and global IPO data:

- Week 1: Retail selling to limit losses
- Month 1: Stock down 10–15%
- Month 3: Stock down 15–20%
- Month 6: Stock down 20–25%

Beyond the financial loss, the reputational damage is severe: investor relations becomes a crisis management exercise; future capital raises face skepticism; management is distracted from operations.

**The clear rule:** Leave 5–10% first-day upside. This is not giving away value - it is buying goodwill and momentum at a price that is typically efficient relative to the longer-term capital markets franchise value.

## Secondary Offering Timing

For companies that have listed successfully, the question of when to issue additional equity matters significantly.

### Optimal Windows

**12–18 months post-IPO (most common and typically most effective):**

Conditions that support a successful secondary:
- Stock trading 15–25% above offer price
- At least two to three quarters of earnings beats (credibility established)
- Positive analyst consensus
- Market conditions favourable

At 15–25% above offer, the company is raising capital at materially better terms than the IPO - and with a proven track record that reduces investor risk perception.

**Example (illustrative):**
- IPO (Month 0): SAR 50/share, raised SAR 1B at 30% float
- Month 12: SAR 62/share (+24%)
- Secondary offering: 10% additional float at SAR 60
- Capital raised: SAR 640M (60% more per share than the IPO)

**6–9 months post-IPO (less common; requires exceptional circumstances):**

Only appropriate when: the stock has risen 30%+ from offer; a time-sensitive major growth catalyst requires immediate capital; and management is confident the momentum is sustainable.

The risk: if momentum fades after the secondary, investors who participated see losses quickly, and the company's capital markets reputation takes a hit disproportionate to the size of the deal.

**24+ months post-IPO (mature issuer profile):**

Appropriate for companies that have established a consistent multi-year public track record. At this stage, the company's credibility is deep, analyst coverage is mature, and institutional relationships are well-established.

### Conditions Where Secondary Offerings Face Headwinds

- Stock trading below the original IPO offer price
- Recent earnings miss (credibility gap; wait for two to three beats before attempting)
- Sector in active downturn (capital is flowing away from the sector)
- Broad market correction (risk-off conditions make equity issuance difficult across the board)

Attempting a secondary in unfavourable conditions typically either fails outright or requires pricing at a discount severe enough to damage the company's public market franchise.

## Aftermarket Timing Patterns: What the Data Shows

Observational patterns from the 2024–2025 Saudi IPO cohort are instructive, though they should be understood as descriptive statistics rather than prescriptive signals.

**Day 1 observations:**
- IPOs with first-day returns below 5% tended to be priced at or near demand capacity - less room for immediate gain, but also less froth
- IPOs with first-day returns above 20% were predominantly in the subsequent quarters - retail flipping activity in this cohort was followed by six-month underperformance in several cases
- Day 1 returns above 20% coincided with the highest subsequent six-month volatility

**Month 1–2 patterns:**
- Companies that beat their first post-IPO results showed a consistent six-month re-rating pattern
- Companies that met but did not beat guidance showed flat-to-modest six-month returns
- Companies that missed first-quarter guidance showed the largest six-month underperformance

**Month 3–6 patterns:**
- Companies trading below offer at month three but with no material negative fundamental development showed a higher rate of recovery by month six than the initial decline would suggest
- Sector alignment (company in a sector with positive news flow) was a stronger predictor of six-month performance than first-day return size

## Strategic Recommendations for Post-IPO Success

### For Management Teams

**Months 0–3 (critical):**
- Prioritise the first earnings report above all other external milestones
- Maintain active investor relations - weekly updates to key institutional holders
- Execute the announced plan - investors will hold management to prospectus guidance
- Communicate early if circumstances change - pre-announce if a miss is likely

**Months 3–6 (building momentum):**
- Announce strategic initiatives that reinforce the growth narrative (M&A, expansion, new partnerships)
- Engage additional sell-side analysts - broader coverage reduces information asymmetry
- Host an investor day - deeper management access builds institutional confidence

**Months 6–12 (positioning for follow-on):**
- Establish a consistent pattern of results that meet or beat guidance
- Target index inclusion (FTSE, MSCI eligibility) if market cap and free float qualify
- Prepare secondary offering materials - be ready when the market window opens

## Series Conclusion: The Integrated Framework

This concludes the eight-part series on Saudi Arabia's IPO market. Across the series we have covered market structure, valuation dynamics, offer sizing, strategic venue selection, investor demand mechanics, failure analysis, foreign investment liberalisation, and aftermarket performance.

The integrated picture for companies planning Saudi IPOs:

- **Venue selection** drives valuation before you ever print a prospectus - the TASI/Nomu gap is structural, not cyclical
- **Positioning at 15–20% discount to peers** is the single highest-impact pricing decision
- **The stepping-stone strategy** is a genuine option for SAR 150–400M companies with the right profile and a credible growth trajectory
- **Avoiding the cancellation categories** - overpricing, weak differentiation, poor timing, inadequate track record - is primarily a preparation and discipline problem
- **February 2026 foreign access** has permanently shifted the TASI advantage, particularly for internationally appealing sectors
- **Aftermarket management begins the day the prospectus is filed** - not the day the stock lists
