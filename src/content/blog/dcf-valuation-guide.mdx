## Why DCF Matters

Every serious investor needs to understand discounted cash flow valuation. It's the gold standard of intrinsic value analysis — and it doesn't need to be complicated.

In this guide, I'll walk you through a practical framework that you can apply to any company in under 5 minutes for a quick sanity check.

## The 5-Minute Framework

### Step 1: Estimate Free Cash Flow

Start with the most recent year's free cash flow (FCF). You can find this on any financial data platform or calculate it:

**FCF = Operating Cash Flow – Capital Expenditures**

For a quick estimate, use:

**FCF ≈ Net Income × (1 – Reinvestment Rate)**

Typical reinvestment rates:
- **Mature companies:** 20-30%
- **Growth companies:** 40-60%
- **High-growth:** 60-80%

### Step 2: Project Growth

Use a two-stage model:
1. **High growth phase** (5 years): Use the company's historical growth rate or analyst consensus
2. **Terminal growth** (forever): Use GDP growth rate (2-3%)

### Step 3: Determine Discount Rate

Use the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC):
- **Saudi large-caps:** 8-10%
- **Saudi mid-caps:** 10-12%
- **Saudi small-caps:** 12-15%

### Step 4: Calculate

Discount all future cash flows back to present value. The sum is your intrinsic value estimate.

### Step 5: Apply Margin of Safety

**Never buy at intrinsic value.** Apply a 15-25% margin of safety to account for estimation errors.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-optimistic growth assumptions** — the most common DCF error
2. **Ignoring capital requirements** — growth requires reinvestment
3. **Terminal value dominance** — if 80%+ of your value is in terminal value, your near-term assumptions are probably wrong
4. **Circular WACC calculations** — you need the value to calculate WACC, but need WACC to calculate value

## Application to Saudi IPOs

When applying DCF to Saudi IPOs, consider:
- **Higher risk premiums** for newly listed companies
- **Limited trading history** makes beta estimation difficult
- **Vision 2030 tailwinds** may justify above-average growth assumptions for certain sectors
- **Currency stability** (SAR pegged to USD) simplifies international comparisons
