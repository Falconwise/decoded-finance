{/* IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: A funnel diagram showing how CAPM inputs - risk-free rate, beta, ERP - combine into a cost of equity estimate, with a cross-check layer below */}

Cost of equity (K_e) is the return required by equity investors. It is a valuation input - not a statement about where a stock is headed.

Saudi models often understate K_e when analysts rely on a mechanically low beta, or when they ignore the liquidity conditions that apply to smaller and less-traded names.

## Start with CAPM

**K_e = R_f + (β × ERP)**

Document each input:
- SAR-consistent R_f (source and tenor)
- Beta method and stability test results
- ERP construction, including any country risk logic
- Any country risk component and where it sits (to avoid double counting)

---

## Dividend Pricing Cross-Check for Mature Dividend Payers

For companies with a stable, mature dividend policy, a useful reasonableness check is:

**K_e ≈ (D₁ / P₀) + g**

Where D₁ is the expected next dividend, P₀ is the current price, and g is a conservative long-run growth rate.

This is a pricing cross-check, not a replacement for CAPM. If CAPM and the dividend check diverge materially, explain the drivers - differences in beta stability, ERP assumptions, or growth expectations. Avoid framing divergence as a claim about mispricing.

## Liquidity Premium as a Sensitivity

For thinly traded names - especially small caps on Nomu or companies with limited float - CAPM may not fully capture liquidity risk. You can model a liquidity premium (LP) as an explicit sensitivity:

**K_e(adjusted) = K_e + LP**

Use an illustrative range such as 0.5%–3.0%, show sensitivity across that range, and document the rationale. Present it as a sensitivity, not a precise computed fact.

## Illustrative Example

| Input | Value |
|-------|-------|
| R_f (SAR, 10-year) | 5.5% |
| ERP | 6.5% |
| Beta | 1.1 |
| **K_e (CAPM)** | **5.5% + (1.1 × 6.5%) = 12.65%** |
| Liquidity premium (illustrative) | 1.0% |
| **K_e (adjusted)** | **13.65%** |

---

## Always Show Sensitivity

Present K_e and the resulting WACC across a sensitivity range. This reduces false precision and makes the model more useful for decision-making - which is the whole point.
