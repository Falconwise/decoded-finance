{/* IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: A timeline infographic showing the two strategic paths — direct TASI listing in Year 1 vs Nomu listing in Year 1 leading to TASI transfer in Year 3 and secondary offering in Year 4 */}

Here is a premise that challenges conventional IPO thinking: **for mid-cap companies, listing on the smaller market first can maximise total capital access and shareholder value over three to five years.**

Most management teams and CFOs assume the goal is straightforward — aim for TASI (Saudi Arabia's main market) from day one. Bigger is better, right? The data tells a more nuanced story for companies with **SAR 150–400 million market capitalisation**.

The "stepping-stone strategy" — listing on Nomu initially, then graduating to TASI after two to three years — can, under the right conditions, deliver:
- **15–22% structural valuation uplift** upon transfer to TASI
- **SAR 2–4 million annual savings** in compliance costs during the growth phase
- **Greater total capital** raised over four to five years versus the direct TASI path
- **Operational flexibility** to execute without the scrutiny of immediate main-market pressure

This piece breaks down the financial logic, examines real graduation cases, and provides a decision framework.

## The Core Economics: A Head-to-Head Comparison

Let's start with a concrete financial model using a realistic mid-cap growth company.

### Company Profile (Illustrative)

- Market cap: SAR 250 million
- Revenue: SAR 180 million (growing 20% annually)
- EBITDA: SAR 45 million (25% margin)
- Capital needed: SAR 75 million for capacity expansion
- Track record: 2.5 years of audited financials, consistently profitable

---

### Scenario A: Direct TASI Listing

**Year 1:**
- List at SAR 250M market cap (stretching to meet the SAR 300M minimum; borderline positioning)
- Float: 30% (TASI standard)
- Offer size: SAR 75M
- All-in costs (3.5%): SAR 2.625M
- Net proceeds: SAR 72.375M

**Years 2–5: TASI Compliance**
- Annual governance costs: SAR 2.5M (independent directors, audit committee, enhanced disclosure, IR function)
- Continuous analyst scrutiny and quarterly earnings pressure from day one
- Four-year compliance cost: SAR 10M

**Year 4 outcome:**
- Net capital raised: SAR 72.375M (Year 1 only, no follow-on)
- Total costs (listing + 4 years compliance): SAR 12.625M
- **Net capital after costs: SAR 59.75M**

---

### Scenario B: Nomu → TASI Stepping Stone

**Year 1: Nomu IPO**
- List at SAR 200M market cap (accepting the Nomu structural discount vs TASI)
- Float: 20% (Nomu minimum, preserving founder control)
- Offer size: SAR 40M
- All-in costs (6%): SAR 2.4M
- Net proceeds: SAR 37.6M

**Years 2–3: Growth on Nomu**
- Annual governance costs: SAR 1M (lighter Nomu requirements)
- Use SAR 37.6M proceeds to execute the expansion plan
- Target: grow to SAR 360M+ market cap by Year 3
- Two-year compliance cost: SAR 2M

**Year 3: Transfer to TASI**
- Market cap pre-transfer: SAR 360M
- Transfer costs: SAR 0.8M
- Structural valuation re-rating on transfer: +18% (based on historical averages from 21 completed transfers)
- Post-transfer market cap: approximately SAR 425M
- No new shares issued at this stage (pure re-rating of existing shares)

**Year 4: Secondary Offering on TASI**
- Increase float by 10% (secondary offering post-re-rating)
- Offer size: SAR 42.5M (10% × SAR 425M)
- All-in costs (3%): SAR 1.275M
- Net proceeds: SAR 41.225M

**Year 4 outcome:**

| Metric | Year-by-Year |
|--------|-------------|
| Year 1 capital raised (net) | SAR 37.6M |
| Year 4 capital raised (net) | SAR 41.225M |
| **Total capital raised** | **SAR 78.825M** |
| Costs (listing + compliance + transfer + secondary) | SAR 6.475M |
| **Net capital after all costs** | **SAR 72.35M** |

---

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Metric | Scenario A (Direct TASI) | Scenario B (Nomu → TASI) |
|--------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| Net capital raised (Year 1) | SAR 72.375M | SAR 37.6M |
| Net capital raised (4-year total) | SAR 59.75M | SAR 72.35M |
| Compliance costs (4 years) | SAR 10M | SAR 3.8M |
| Market cap (Year 4) | SAR 250M (stayed flat under TASI pressure) | SAR 425M |
| Founder wealth (70% stake, Year 4) | SAR 175M | SAR 297.5M |

The stepping-stone advantage compounds through three mechanisms:
1. **Operational execution:** Lighter compliance in Years 1–3 allows management to focus on growth rather than reporting
2. **Transfer re-rating:** The 15–22% valuation uplift on TASI graduation is captured by existing shareholders at no cost
3. **Higher secondary pricing:** The Year 4 offering is at SAR 425M valuation versus SAR 250M — 70% more purchasing power for the same equity percentage

## Transfer Requirements: The Regulatory Framework

### Prerequisites for TASI Graduation from Nomu

**Time requirement:**
- Minimum two years listed on Nomu before transfer application
- Practically optimal window: 2.5–3 years
- Beyond four years: "stuck" perception begins to form — markets question why graduation has been delayed

**Market capitalisation:**
- SAR 200M average market cap during the six months preceding the application
- This is lower than TASI's standard SAR 300M minimum (the regulatory structure incentivises graduation)
- Must demonstrate a stable or improving valuation trajectory

**Governance standards:**
- Must meet all TASI governance requirements at the time of transfer
- Board independence: 33% minimum independent directors
- Audit committee with external members
- Related-party transactions disclosed and conducted at arm's length

**Disclosure history:**
- Clean CMA record (no violations)
- Timely financial reporting throughout the Nomu period
- No material unresolved legal disputes or undisclosed contingencies

**Free float:**
- Maintain sufficient public float (20%+ from the Nomu listing)
- Can be increased to 30% via secondary offering post-transfer

### Transfer Process Timeline

| Stage | Timing |
|-------|--------|
| Board approval and public disclosure | Month 0 |
| Formal application to Tadawul | Month 1 |
| CMA regulatory review | Months 2–5 |
| Approval, 5-day trading suspension | Month 5 |
| TASI trading begins | Month 5, Day 6 |

Total process: four to six months from board decision to active TASI trading.

## Real Transfer Cases: Evidence from the Market

### Case Study 1: Saudi Azm — The Benchmark Transfer

**Company:** Building materials and construction supplies

**Nomu period (2020–2024):**
- Listed: March 2020
- Time on Nomu: approximately 4 years
- Performance: Steady growth and product line expansion
- Final Nomu market cap: SAR 580M

**Transfer to TASI (March 2024):**
- Transfer price: SAR 35/share (carried over from Nomu)
- Market cap at transfer: SAR 580M

**Post-transfer outcome (six months):**
- Six-month price: SAR 43.75/share
- Return from transfer price: +25%
- Market cap: SAR 725M
- Structural value created: SAR 145M market cap gain

**What drove the re-rating:**
- Liquidity expansion — TASI daily volume approximately 18x higher than the Nomu average
- Retail participation — construction materials have strong retail investor recognition
- Index inclusion eligibility (FTSE Russell Saudi Arabia)
- Foreign investor access opened up

**Lesson:** A four-year Nomu period built a credible track record before graduation. The construction sector benefited significantly from TASI retail access. The +25% re-rating in six months represents a real, empirically documented liquidity premium.

### Case Study 2: Nofoth Food Products — January 2026

**Company:** Regional packaged food manufacturing and distribution

**Nomu period (January 2023 – December 2025):**
- Listed: January 2023
- IPO price: SAR 150/share (pre-split); adjusted to SAR 15/share after 10:1 split in June 2023
- Final Nomu price: SAR 9.79 (December 31, 2025)
- Final Nomu market cap: SAR 940M

**Nomu performance context:**
- The -35% return from the adjusted IPO price reflects a combination of share dilution from capital increases, the broader Nomu index declining -26% in 2025, and limited investor access
- Revenue grew during the period; the price decline reflects structural market factors as much as business fundamentals

**Transfer to TASI (January 21, 2026):**
- TASI opening price: SAR 9.79 (carried over)
- Market cap at transfer: SAR 940M
- Sector reclassification: Food & Beverages (TASI)

**Structural change at transfer:**
- Food & Beverages TASI peers trade at approximately 13–15x P/E (Almarai, Savola)
- Nomu had no equivalent food company peer set — Nofoth was valued in a vacuum
- Post-transfer, investors can now apply sector-appropriate multiples
- Foreign access opened on 1 February 2026 — direct international F&B investors eligible

**What to watch:** Earnings delivery in Q1 2026 will be the critical signal. Companies that beat their first post-transfer quarter tend to experience significantly larger re-ratings.

### Case Study 3: Obeikan Glass — Industrial Sector, July 2025

**Company:** Flat glass and architectural glass manufacturing

**Nomu period (2022 – July 2025):**
- Time on Nomu: approximately 3.5 years
- Market cap growth: SAR 320M to SAR 485M (+52% organic growth)

**Transfer to TASI (July 2025):**
- Market cap at transfer: SAR 485M
- Early performance: approximately +12% in the first two months

**Pattern:** Industrial companies — B2B, capital-intensive, limited retail name recognition — tend to generate smaller re-ratings on transfer (+12–18%) compared to consumer-facing companies (+20–30%). The liquidity premium is present, but the retail demand amplifier is not.

## Historical Transfer Performance: 21-Company Dataset

| Cohort | Companies | Avg Nomu Duration | Post-Transfer 6M Return |
|--------|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| 2019–2020 | 8 | 2.8 years | +18% average |
| 2021–2023 | 5 | 3.2 years | +12% average |
| 2024–2026 | 8 | 3.4 years | +15–20% (in progress) |

**Aggregate weighted average: +17.5% within six to twelve months of transfer**

### Decomposing the Gain

**Liquidity premium (10–15%):**
- Bid-ask spreads narrow from 1–3% to 0.2–0.5%
- Trading volume increases 10–30x
- Institutional exit confidence improves materially

**Investor base expansion (5–8%):**
- Retail access: 6.5 million new potential shareholders
- Foreign investors: direct access (post-February 2026)
- Passive funds: index inclusion opportunities

**Reduced information asymmetry (2–4%):**
- Analyst coverage increases on TASI names
- Business press covers TASI more actively
- Governance upgrade signal is read as a positive quality indicator

**Sector-specific variations:**
- Consumer and healthcare: +20–30% (retail demand amplifier)
- Industrial: +12–18% (liquidity premium only)
- Technology: +15–22% (institutional focus)

---

## Decision Framework: When to Use the Stepping-Stone Path

### Stepping-stone works well when:

- **Market cap is SAR 150–400M** — below comfortable TASI entry but viable for Nomu
- **Capital needs are below SAR 100M initially** — manageable with a 20–25% Nomu float
- **A credible 3–5 year growth trajectory exists** to reach SAR 200M+ market cap for transfer eligibility
- **Management prefers lighter compliance** during the execution phase
- **The sector has established TASI comparables** that provide a re-rating anchor on graduation
- **Foreign investor access is not urgent** from day one
- **The business model allows a two to three year proof period** — B2B, industrial, and logistics companies that scale gradually

**Suitable sectors:** Logistics and transportation, industrial manufacturing, food and beverage distribution, healthcare services in the ramp-up phase, speciality retail building a network.

### Direct TASI is the better path when:

- **Market cap exceeds SAR 500M** — clearly above TASI standards with a comfortable buffer
- **Immediate capital need exceeds SAR 300M** — Nomu cannot absorb this volume at reasonable pricing
- **Strong consumer brand with retail appeal** — the TASI premium is immediate and large; waiting costs more than the compliance savings
- **Foreign investor access is strategically critical from day one** — Nomu will not deliver this
- **Industry credibility demands maximum status immediately** — banking, insurance, well-established healthcare
- **Time-sensitive opportunity** — competitive pressure or a market window that cannot wait

**Suitable sectors:** Aviation and tourism, consumer retail with national brand recognition, hospital chains, financial services, technology platforms with immediate scale.

## Tactical Execution: Getting the Most from the Stepping-Stone Path

### Before the Nomu IPO

**Disclose graduation intentions:** Including a statement in the prospectus about plans to transfer to TASI within three years — subject to regulatory approval and meeting eligibility criteria — can reduce the Nomu structural discount by three to five percentage points. Investors price in the optionality.

**Adopt TASI governance from day one:** Appoint 33%+ independent directors, implement quarterly reporting (not required on Nomu but builds institutional credibility), and establish audit and governance committees. Companies that trade at "Nomu floor plus TASI option premium" do so because governance quality signals eventual graduation.

**Target 25% float, not the 20% minimum:** Better initial liquidity, a stronger signal of market commitment, and an easier transition toward the 30% TASI standard.

### During the Nomu Period

**Build analyst coverage:** Engage sell-side analysts proactively. Host quarterly earnings calls. Even two or three research reports significantly reduce information asymmetry and improve valuation discovery.

**Execute against the growth plan:** This is the most important variable of all. Investors will only re-rate a company that delivers on the promises made at IPO. Revenue CAGR in the 15–25% range, margin stability or improvement, and milestone delivery are what create the SAR 360M+ market cap that makes the transfer case compelling.

**Maintain a clean regulatory record:** Zero CMA violations or late filings. Resolve related-party transactions. Any governance gap discovered in the CMA transfer review can delay or derail the graduation.

### Transfer Timing

**Pre-announce intentions at Month 18–22:** Board approval at the 22-month mark (before the 2-year minimum expires) triggers market anticipation of the transfer premium. Companies that announce publicly tend to see partial re-pricing three to six months ahead of the actual transfer.

**Align with a strong earnings period:** Transfer announcements concurrent with positive results generate larger initial re-ratings. Avoid transfers during sector downturns or broad market corrections where possible.

**Consider an institutional pre-transfer roadshow:** Meeting TASI-focused institutional investors ahead of the migration builds demand for the stock's first weeks of main-market trading.

### After the TASI Transfer

**Wait 12–18 months before a secondary offering:** Allow the re-rating to stabilise and at least two quarterly results to demonstrate post-transfer performance consistency.

**Target index inclusion:** FTSE Russell Saudi Arabia inclusion requires consistent market cap, free float, and trading volume thresholds. Passive inflows from index-tracking funds represent a sustained, non-sentiment-driven demand layer.

---

## Common Pitfalls

**Staying on Nomu too long:**
Companies exceeding SAR 300M market cap while remaining on Nomu begin to face a "stuck" perception — the market starts asking why they have not graduated. This adds five to ten percentage points to the existing structural discount. Plan to transfer before the company approaches SAR 300M market cap, not after it has comfortably exceeded it.

**Under-investing in governance during the Nomu period:**
Treating Nomu as a permanent "easy path" and deferring governance improvements leads to CMA transfer review complications. Implement TASI-standard governance from the Nomu IPO date.

**Poor transfer timing:**
Applying for transfer during a TASI correction reduces the re-rating the company captures. Having the flexibility to delay the formal application by two to three months to wait for better market conditions pays off significantly on a re-rating that historically has averaged 15–22%.

**Ignoring the post-transfer secondary offering:**
The stepping-stone's full financial benefit is only realised if the company executes a secondary offering at the higher post-transfer valuation. Budget for this, reserve board authorisation, and plan the timing alongside growth milestones.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The logic is sound:** For SAR 150–400M companies with the right profile, the stepping-stone strategy generates more net capital over four to five years and materially improves founder economics
2. **Compliance savings matter:** TASI governance costs SAR 2–3M more annually than Nomu — over three years, that is SAR 6–9M that stays in the business during the critical growth phase
3. **Transfer requirements are clear:** Minimum two years, SAR 200M average market cap, TASI governance standards, clean regulatory record
4. **The data is consistent:** 21 historical transfers averaged +17.5% valuation gain within six to twelve months (range: +12% to +25%)
5. **Sweet spot:** 2.5–3 years on Nomu — long enough to build a credible track record, short enough to avoid the "stuck" perception
6. **Sector shapes the outcome:** Consumer and healthcare get the largest re-ratings; industrial and B2B get the smallest — all benefit from the liquidity premium
7. **Execution matters most:** Delivering on the growth plan during the Nomu period is the single biggest driver of re-rating potential
