Hybrid instruments can materially shift WACC and leverage ratios. The safest approach — and the most defensible — is to classify them based on their contractual cash flow features and seniority, not their accounting label.

---

## Why Hybrids Matter

Misclassifying a hybrid as pure debt understates WACC. Misclassifying it as pure equity can overstate leverage capacity. Both errors have meaningful consequences for valuation and credit analysis.

---

## Perpetual or Tier 1 Sukuk

Perpetual sukuk with subordinated claims and discretionary (deferrable) distributions sit at the boundary between debt and equity. Because these instruments share features with both:

- Assign partial **equity credit** — the common approach is to test equity credit of 0%, 50%, and 100%, and show WACC sensitivity across that range
- Do not treat them as simple vanilla debt in the WACC weights

For bank-issued Tier 1 capital sukuk, the regulatory treatment provides useful guidance on the equity/debt split, though valuation treatment and regulatory capital treatment do not always align.

---

## Shareholder Funding

Loans from controlling shareholders or related parties require careful classification. The key questions are:
- Is there a defined repayment obligation?
- Is the instrument subordinated to other creditors?
- Are payments discretionary or contractually required?

If the instrument behaves like equity in substance — discretionary payments, no fixed maturity, deeply subordinated — treat part of it as equity in the capital structure and document the reasoning.

---

## Convertibles

Convertible instruments (bonds or sukuk with conversion rights) are best handled through scenario analysis:
- **Debt-only scenario** — instruments convert at maturity only if forced
- **Equity conversion scenario** — instruments convert upon a trigger or election

Avoid treating conversion as a single-point forecast. Show both scenarios in the WACC weights and the resulting valuation range.

---

## Presenting Results

Show WACC under different equity credit assumptions for any hybrid in the capital structure. This keeps the model honest and makes the uncertainty visible to any reviewer.
