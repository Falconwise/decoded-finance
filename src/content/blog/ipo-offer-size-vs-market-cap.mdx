"We're raising SAR 300 million in our IPO."

"So your company is worth SAR 300 million?"

**"No — we're worth SAR 1 billion."**

This conversation happens in every CFO's office during IPO planning. The confusion between offer size (capital raised) and market capitalisation (total company value) is one of the most common — and costly — misunderstandings in capital markets.

Misunderstanding this distinction can lead to significantly underpricing an IPO or, worse, overpricing it and facing a failed offering. This guide decodes the math, explains what underwriters mean by "30% float," analyses real Saudi IPO examples from 2024–2025, and provides a framework for setting realistic valuation expectations.

## The Core Distinction

### Offer Size (Capital Raised)

**Definition:** The amount of cash the company receives from selling shares to investors during the IPO.

**Formula:** `Offer Size = Offer Price × Number of Shares Sold`

**Example:**
- Offer price: SAR 50/share
- Shares sold: 6 million
- **Offer size: SAR 300 million**

Offer size is what flows into the company (minus fees). It represents the percentage of total equity you are selling — typically 20–30%. It is what investors subscribe to during book-building, and it determines underwriting fees.

---

### Market Capitalisation (Total Company Value)

**Definition:** The value the market assigns to the entire business — all outstanding shares, not just what you're selling.

**Formula:** `Market Cap = Share Price × ALL Outstanding Shares (Post-IPO)`

**Using the same example:**
- Share price: SAR 50/share
- Total shares outstanding after IPO: 20 million
- **Market cap: SAR 1 billion**

Market cap is how analysts compute valuation multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA). It determines index eligibility and ranking among peers. It is the number that matters for how your company is valued — not the capital raised.

---

### The Mathematical Relationship

If you sell **30% of your company** in the IPO (the TASI standard):

**Market Cap = Offer Size ÷ 0.30 = Offer Size × 3.33**

| Offer Size | Float % | Implied Market Cap |
|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| SAR 300M | 30% | SAR 1,000M |
| SAR 500M | 30% | SAR 1,667M |
| SAR 1B | 30% | SAR 3,333M |
| SAR 75M | 20% | SAR 375M |

When you tell investors "we are raising SAR 300 million at 30% float," you are implicitly claiming your company is worth **SAR 1 billion**. Make sure the fundamentals support that valuation.

---

## Why the 30% Float Convention Exists

The 30% free float requirement on TASI is not arbitrary. It is designed to ensure sufficient liquidity for efficient price discovery.

### Regulatory Requirements

| Market | Free Float Minimum | Purpose |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| TASI | 30% | Main market depth |
| Nomu | 20% | Growth-stage flexibility |

### The Practical Logic

- **Below 20%:** Too few shares available → illiquid trading, wide bid-ask spreads
- **20–30%:** Adequate for institutional trading, but potential for volatility
- **30–40%:** Optimal range for efficient price discovery and stable trading
- **Above 40%:** Rare; typically means the founder is raising growth capital aggressively

A 30% IPO leaves founders with **70% ownership** — maintaining effective control while accessing capital. This is the standard that balances liquidity needs with founder economics, and it has become the default for Saudi TASI listings.

## Real Saudi IPO Examples (2024–2025)

### Flynas (Aviation) — May 2025

- **Offer size:** SAR 4.1 billion
- **Float:** 30%
- **Implied market cap:** SAR 4.1B ÷ 0.30 = **SAR 13.67 billion**
- **Offer price:** SAR 50/share (priced at top of SAR 45–50 range)
- **Shares sold:** 82 million shares
- **Revenue (2024):** SAR 6.8 billion
- **Implied price/revenue:** 2.0x

**Investor demand:**
- Institutional oversubscription: 100x
- Retail oversubscription: 350%
- Total demand generated: SAR 400–600 billion

The SAR 4.1B "raise" generates the headlines, but the real story is the **SAR 13.67B valuation** the market assigned to the entire business. The extreme oversubscription indicates investors regarded this valuation as fair or even conservative at the time.

---

### Fakeeh Care (Healthcare) — April 2025

- **Offer size:** SAR 2.9 billion
- **Float:** 30%
- **Implied market cap:** SAR 9.67 billion
- **Offer price:** SAR 58/share (top of SAR 52–58 range)
- **Revenue (2024):** SAR 3.2 billion
- **EBITDA (2024):** SAR 720 million
- **Implied EV/EBITDA:** approximately 13.4x

Healthcare typically commands premium multiples. Fakeeh's 13.4x EV/EBITDA reflects defensive revenue characteristics, recurring patient relationships, and the Vision 2030 medical tourism backdrop.

---

### Saudi Parts Store (Consumer) — June 2025

- **Offer size:** SAR 1.96 billion
- **Float:** 30%
- **Implied market cap:** SAR 6.53 billion
- **Offer price:** SAR 65/share
- **Revenue (2024):** SAR 2.8 billion
- **Net income (2024):** SAR 385 million
- **Implied P/E:** 17.0x

Strong net margins (13.8%) and broad retail recognition drove the 241x institutional oversubscription — the highest of any 2025 TASI deal.

---

### Khaldi Logistics (Nomu) — March 2025

- **Offer size:** SAR 75 million
- **Float:** 20% (Nomu minimum)
- **Implied market cap:** SAR 375 million
- **Offer price:** SAR 30/share
- **Revenue (2024):** SAR 210 million
- **Implied price/revenue:** 1.8x

At 1.8x revenue versus 2.5–3.0x for comparable TASI logistics companies, the Nomu structural discount is visible in the numbers. The 1,949% institutional oversubscription reflects the small denominator effect: institutions bidding SAR 1.5B+ for a SAR 75M offering produces extreme multiples that signal demand intensity, but not necessarily that the company was underpriced to the same degree.

## How Underwriters Think About Pricing

Understanding the underwriter's framework helps set realistic expectations.

### Step 1: Comparable Company Analysis

Select 3–5 peers by sector, size (revenue/EBITDA within 30–50%), market, and growth profile. Extract average valuation multiples from current trading prices, then apply an IPO discount — typically 10–20% — to price the offering below where comparable established peers trade.

**Healthcare example:**
- Peer 1: P/E 18x
- Peer 2: P/E 16x
- Peer 3: P/E 15x
- Average: 16.3x
- IPO discount (15%): → **Target IPO P/E: 13.9x**

The IPO discount compensates investors for the additional uncertainty of a newly listed company — shorter public track record, less analyst coverage, less price discovery.

### Step 2: DCF Validation

Build a 5-year model with revenue projections, margin assumptions, and capex requirements. Discount at WACC (9–12% typical for Saudi companies) and a terminal growth rate consistent with long-run GDP.

DCF provides an intrinsic value anchor that complements the multiples-based analysis. Where the two converge, the pricing range is more credible.

### Step 3: Precedent Transaction Analysis

Review pricing outcomes from recent comparable IPOs — where they priced within their range (top, middle, or bottom), first-day returns, and 6-month aftermarket performance. Recent precedents that performed well allow underwriters to target the upper end of the range.

### Step 4: Institutional Soundings (Pre-Marketing)

Two to three weeks before formal book-building, financial advisors test price ranges with anchor investors and assess demand elasticity. If SAR 50/share generates 20x demand, there is pricing room above SAR 50. If it generates only 1.5x, the price needs adjusting downward.

### Step 5: Final Pricing

Triangulate across comparable multiples, DCF, precedents, and real-time institutional demand. Standard practice is to leave 5–10% "first-day upside" — not because value is being given away, but because a modest positive first day creates momentum, generates media coverage, and establishes a strong foundation for the aftermarket.

---

## 2025 Pricing Outcomes

- **87% of 2025 Saudi IPOs priced at the top of their range**
- Average first-day return: +8.5% (TASI), +12.3% (Nomu)
- Median first-day return: +5.2% (TASI), +9.8% (Nomu)

Priced at top with 5–10% first-day gain represents efficient pricing — demand exceeded supply at the top of the range, and investors received a modest premium for participation.

**What excessive underpricing costs:**
If a company raises SAR 1B at SAR 50/share and the stock closes Day 1 at SAR 60 (+20%), the implied foregone proceeds are approximately SAR 200M — capital the company could have raised at the higher price.

**What overpricing costs:**
A negative first-day return creates immediate underwater retail investors, institutional flippers exit, confidence evaporates, and the aftermarket struggles. This compounds over months and can make follow-on capital raises significantly harder.

## Common Valuation Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Confusing Offer Size with Valuation

"We need SAR 500M for expansion, so we're doing a SAR 500M IPO — that's our value."

The correct framing: SAR 500M at 30% float implies **SAR 1.67B valuation**. Does the revenue, EBITDA, and growth rate support that? Work backwards from the required capital to the implied valuation, then validate the multiples.

### Mistake 2: Anchoring on a Competitor's Offer Size

"Our competitor raised SAR 300M — so should we."

If your competitor has SAR 500M revenue and yours is SAR 300M, the same 2.0x revenue multiple means you should raise approximately SAR 180M (30% of SAR 600M implied market cap), not SAR 300M. Compare **valuation multiples**, not absolute offer sizes.

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the Float Percentage Variable

"We want SAR 400M but don't want to dilute more than 20%."

SAR 400M at 20% float implies SAR 2.0B market cap. SAR 400M at 30% float implies SAR 1.33B market cap. Changing the float percentage changes the implied valuation by 50% — the market cap, and therefore the story you need to tell to justify the pricing, is materially different.

### Mistake 4: Applying Peak Peer Multiples to an IPO-Stage Company

"The leading tech company trades at 25x P/E — so should we."

That company has ten years of public track record, proven profitability, and deep analyst coverage. An IPO-stage company typically needs to offer a 15–25% discount to established peers. A 22x peer average after a 20% discount gives a target IPO P/E of approximately 17.6x — still a strong multiple, but realistic.

---

## Practical Framework: Setting Your Valuation Range

1. **Identify 3–5 comparable public companies** — same sector, similar size and growth profile
2. **Extract valuation multiples** (P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA) from current trading prices
3. **Apply a 15–20% IPO discount** to the peer average multiple
4. **Calculate implied valuation range** using your LTM revenue/EBITDA/earnings
5. **Choose float percentage** based on capital needs and control preferences
6. **Derive offer size:** Offer Size = Valuation × Float %
7. **Validate with DCF:** If the DCF output falls within or near the multiples-derived range, pricing is credible; if there is a large gap, investigate the drivers

## Sector Valuation Benchmarks (Saudi, 2024–2025)

| Sector | Revenue Multiple Range | EV/EBITDA Range | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Technology / High-growth | 4–5x | N/A (pre-profit) | Network effect premium |
| Healthcare | 2.8–3.0x | 12–15x | Defensive + medical tourism |
| Consumer / Retail | 1.8–2.3x | 9–12x | Brand and margin driven |
| Logistics | 2.0–2.1x | 10–12x | Asset-light scaling |
| Industrial | 1.2–1.8x | 7–10x | Cyclical, capital-intensive |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Offer size ≠ market cap:** Offer size is capital raised; market cap is total company value. At 30% float, market cap equals offer size × 3.33
2. **Float percentage drives the implied valuation:** 20% vs 30% float on the same offer creates a 50% difference in implied market cap
3. **87% of 2025 Saudi IPOs priced at the top of range:** Strong demand environment; first-day returns averaged +8.5% TASI, +12.3% Nomu
4. **Underwriter framework:** Triangulate comparables, DCF, and precedent transactions; apply 15–20% IPO discount to established peer multiples
5. **Common mistakes:** Anchoring on offer size rather than multiples; ignoring the float variable; applying peak peer multiples without the IPO discount
6. **Work backwards:** Start from capital needed → derive implied valuation → validate against multiples and fundamentals
