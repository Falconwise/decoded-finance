{/* IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: A two-path decision tree showing when to use after-tax vs pre-tax cost of debt in WACC, depending on Zakat vs income tax status */}

A common error in Saudi WACC models is applying a foreign after-tax debt formula without first checking whether the same interest deductibility applies to the entity being valued.

Get this wrong and WACC is understated — sometimes meaningfully.

---

## The Standard Textbook Formula

**WACC = (w_e × K_e) + [w_d × K_d × (1 − t)]**

This formula assumes a corporate income tax shield: that interest expense reduces taxable income, making debt financing cheaper than its face cost.

## Practical Modeling Defaults for Saudi Entities

| Entity Type | Default Treatment | Rationale |
|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| Income tax payer | K_d × (1 − t) | Standard tax shield applies |
| Zakat payer | K_d (pre-tax) | Conventional interest deduction not established |
| Mixed structure | Weighted blend | Document clearly with entity-level detail |

For Zakat payers, the conservative and defensible default is to treat K_d at its full pre-tax rate, unless you have specific, documented evidence that an interest tax shield is available to the entity.

---

## Mixed Structures

Some Saudi entities pay both Zakat and corporate income tax — for example, companies with foreign ownership stakes above certain thresholds. In these cases, you can approximate an effective shield factor and apply it to K_d. This must be grounded in the entity's actual structure and supported by qualified tax advice where required.

## Why Sensitivity Is Mandatory Here

The difference between assuming a full tax shield and assuming none can be 50–100 basis points in WACC. That is not a rounding error — it is a material valuation input.

Show WACC under both assumptions and present valuation sensitivity to the range. This is more honest and more useful than claiming precision on a point that requires professional tax judgment.
