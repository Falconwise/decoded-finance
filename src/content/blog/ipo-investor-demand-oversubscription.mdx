"We achieved 450x oversubscription!"

Sounds like a home run. But here is what that headline does not tell you: **the company only raised SAR 346 million despite receiving orders representing billions in demand.** More than 99% of investor demand was rejected.

Saudi Arabia's IPO market consistently generates spectacular oversubscription numbers — 100x, 200x, even 450x on some deals — but what do these metrics actually measure? More importantly, how should a company interpret and act on them during IPO planning?

Understanding oversubscription mechanics matters because it determines your allocation strategy, signals post-IPO trading dynamics, influences whether you can price at the top of your range, and affects whether the stock holds up in the aftermarket. Let's decode the numbers.

## Oversubscription Basics: The Maths Behind the Headlines

### What Is Oversubscription?

**Definition:** The ratio of total investor demand to shares available for sale.

**Formula:** `Oversubscription = Total Demand ÷ Shares Available`

**Example:**
- Shares available: 10 million
- Investor orders: 100 million shares
- **Oversubscription: 10x (or 1,000%)**

### Institutional vs Retail Oversubscription

Saudi IPOs measure these separately because allocation rules differ.

**Institutional tranche (typically 70% of the offering):**

`Institutional Oversubscription = Institutional Orders ÷ Institutional Allocation`

Example — 7 million shares available, 700 million shares in orders → **100x institutional oversubscription**

**Retail tranche (the CMA's October 2025 guidance targets ~30% of the offering):**

`Retail Oversubscription = Retail Subscription Value ÷ Retail Allocation Value`

Example — SAR 150M available, SAR 600M in subscriptions received → **4x retail oversubscription (400%)**

### Why Separate Metrics Matter

**Institutional oversubscription signals:**
- Professional investor conviction (often referred to as "smart money" validation)
- Likely aftermarket support (institutions typically hold longer-term positions)
- Pricing power at the top of the range (50x+ institutional gives confidence)

**Retail oversubscription signals:**
- Consumer brand awareness and recognition
- Potential aftermarket volatility (retail investors generally have shorter holding periods)
- Allocation adequacy (underallocated retail can generate selling pressure on day one)

## 2025 Oversubscription Leaders: The Standout Deals

### TASI Leaders

**Saudi Parts Store (Consumer Automotive)**
- Institutional oversubscription: **241x**
- Offer size: SAR 1.96 billion
- Implied institutional demand: approximately SAR 330 billion
- Offer price: SAR 65 (top of SAR 60–65 range)

What drove such high demand?
- **Brand recognition:** Nationally known retailer with 150+ locations
- **Consumer touchpoint:** Car owners as a direct customer base
- **Defensive characteristics:** Aftermarket parts represent recurring, largely non-cyclical revenue
- **Profitability:** 13.8% net margins — exceptional for retail
- **Growth story:** E-commerce and regional footprint expansion

---

**Fakeeh Care (Healthcare)**
- Institutional oversubscription: **162x**
- Offer size: SAR 2.9 billion
- Offer price: SAR 58 (top of SAR 52–58 range)

Key demand drivers:
- **Defensive sector:** Healthcare revenue is largely recession-resistant
- **Vision 2030 alignment:** Medical tourism and health transformation initiative
- **Proven track record:** 40+ years of operating history with consistent profitability
- **Recurring revenue:** Long-term care, insurance contracts, stable patient base

---

**Flynas (Aviation)**
- Institutional oversubscription: **100x**
- Retail oversubscription: **350%**
- Offer size: SAR 4.1 billion (largest 2025 Saudi IPO)
- Total demand generated: SAR 400–600 billion

Why landmark demand?
- **Scarcity value:** The only airline IPO in the Gulf in two decades — investors had no alternative public exposure to the region's aviation growth
- **Vision 2030 mega-theme:** Tourism transformation and connectivity expansion
- **Growth trajectory:** 25% annual passenger growth (2020–2024)
- **Profitability:** Rare among MENA aviation carriers
- **Consumer visibility:** Every Saudi has encountered the brand

**Key insight:** First-of-its-kind IPOs in high-visibility sectors generate outsized demand because investors have no existing route to the exposure.

### Nomu Leaders

**Khaldi Logistics**
- Institutional oversubscription: **1,949% (19.5x)**
- Offer size: SAR 75 million (small)
- Implied institutional demand: approximately SAR 1.5 billion

Why extreme oversubscription on a small deal?

This is the "small offer size" mathematical effect at work:

```
If 10 institutions each seek SAR 150M exposure:
Total demand = SAR 1.5B
Offer size = SAR 75M
Result = 20x (1,949%) oversubscription

Same institutions bidding for a SAR 500M TASI deal:
Total demand = SAR 1.5B
Offer size = SAR 500M
Result = 3x (300%) oversubscription — same appetite, different denominator
```

The 19.5x oversubscription reflects demand intensity relative to size, but should not be compared directly to a large TASI deal's oversubscription multiple.

---

**Alwazn Almithaly (Consumer Goods)**
- Institutional oversubscription: **450x**
- Offer size: SAR 346 million
- Implied institutional demand: approximately SAR 155 billion
- Sector: Health and wellness products

The 450x headline reflects both genuine institutional interest and the small-denominator effect of a SAR 346M deal attracting large institutional orders.

---

**Arabica Star (Coffee Retail)**
- Institutional oversubscription: **208x**
- Offer size: SAR 230 million
- Sector: Coffee retail and distribution

Category growth (coffee culture expanding rapidly in Saudi Arabia), brand equity, and a scalable franchise model drove strong demand.

## The Oversubscription Paradox: Higher Isn't Always Better

Here is a counterintuitive truth: **extreme oversubscription can signal underpricing, not success.**

### The Underpricing Problem

When a SAR 346M offering attracts 450x institutional demand, the implied signal is: the offer could have been priced significantly higher and still achieved full subscription — meaning the company left capital on the table.

**The maths:**
- Actual pricing: SAR 50/share (hypothetical)
- Institutional demand: 450x
- Implied ceiling: The offer could potentially have been priced at SAR 100–120/share and still achieved 150–200x oversubscription at the higher level
- Foregone capital: If priced at SAR 100 instead of SAR 50, the company could have raised SAR 692M instead of SAR 346M — the difference is approximately SAR 346M in unrealised proceeds

### What Good vs Problematic Oversubscription Looks Like

**Well-priced offering:**
- 30–80x institutional oversubscription
- 300–600% retail oversubscription
- First-day return: 5–10%
- Signal: Strong demand without dramatic underpricing; investors receive a reasonable premium for participation

**Potentially underpriced:**
- 200x+ institutional oversubscription
- First-day return: above 20%
- Signal: Could have priced materially higher; existing shareholders may have foregone significant proceeds

**Overpriced:**
- Below 2–3x institutional oversubscription (TASI) or below 1.5x (Nomu)
- First-day return: flat or negative
- Signal: Demand insufficient at the chosen price; cancellation risk or aftermarket pressure

**Optimal target range:**
- **30–80x institutional** (robust demand without extreme underpricing)
- **300–600% retail** (strong enthusiasm, manageable allocation)
- **First-day return 5–10%** (efficient pricing, modest positive start)

## The CMA's 30% Retail Allocation Guidance (October 2025)

A significant policy shift has reshaped how Saudi IPOs are structured.

### What Changed

Before October 2025, the typical allocation was 70–80% institutional and 20–30% retail.

The CMA's October 2025 guidance encourages issuers to target **approximately 30% retail allocation** — aligning with Vision 2030's wealth distribution goals and market development priorities.

### Why the CMA Made This Change

**Wealth distribution:** Government privatisations explicitly target citizen wealth creation and broader economic participation.

**Liquidity enhancement:** A broader shareholder base improves aftermarket trading depth and reduces single-institution dominance.

**Company brand building:** Consumer-facing companies benefit significantly from customer-shareholders — they become advocates.

**Market development:** With 6.5 million retail brokerage accounts in Saudi Arabia, activating retail participation deepens the market.

### Impact on IPO Strategy

Companies now need to build a genuine retail narrative — not just the institutional investment case. Practical implications:

**Marketing approach shift:**
- Traditional roadshow: 80% institutional meetings
- New approach: 40% institutional + 30% media and retail engagement + 30% digital marketing

**Pricing considerations:**
- Retail investors tend to be somewhat less price-sensitive than institutions when brand loyalty is high
- Consumer-facing companies can sometimes command a 5–10% premium if retail enthusiasm is genuinely strong
- Underallocated retail (when oversubscribed) creates day-one selling pressure — manage this through pricing

## What Drives Institutional Demand

Understanding what professional investors look for helps structure the offering to maximise their participation.

### Valuation vs Peers (Multiple Arbitrage)

Institutions run detailed comparable company analysis:

```
Your IPO P/E: 14x
Peer average: 17x

Institutional logic:
"If this company re-rates to 16–17x — the sector average — that's 14–21% appreciation from entry."
```

Institutional demand is highest when the IPO is priced at a **10–20% discount** to established peers. When priced at or above peer multiples, the "re-rating upside" narrative disappears.

### Growth vs Valuation (Growth-to-Multiple Ratio)

```
Your company revenue CAGR: 22%
Sector average CAGR: 12%

Growth advantage: 1.83x
Your P/E: 16x (14% premium over 14x peer)

Institutional view:
"Growing 83% faster but only 14% more expensive — there's embedded value."
```

### Free Float and Liquidity

Institutions need exit confidence.

- **30%+ free float:** High institutional demand (can exit SAR 100M+ positions without significant price impact)
- **Below 25% float:** Institutional demand discount (liquidity risk priced into bids)

### Lock-Up Structure

```
Scenario A: 12-month founder lock-up → supply overhang in Year 2
Scenario B: 24-month lock-up with staggered release → supply predictability → higher institutional bids
```

**Longer lock-ups with staggered release schedules consistently attract more institutional demand.**

### Sector Momentum

**2025 high-demand sectors:** Healthcare (Vision 2030 medical tourism), logistics (e-commerce infrastructure), aviation and tourism (connectivity boom), consumer discretionary (rising incomes).

**Lower-demand sectors:** Traditional retail (disruption concerns), cyclical industrials, real estate (regulatory complexity).

---

## What Drives Retail Demand

### Brand Recognition and Familiarity

Retail investors gravitate toward companies they know directly:
- Flynas: every Saudi has encountered the brand
- Saudi Parts Store: 150+ locations nationwide
- Arabica Star: frequented coffee retailer

**High retail demand:** national consumer brands with direct touchpoints. **Low retail demand:** B2B companies, industrials, low consumer visibility.

### Story Simplicity

Retail needs a one-sentence equity story.

- **Works:** "We deliver food to your home. Delivery is growing 30% annually."
- **Doesn't work:** "We provide integrated logistics solutions leveraging synergistic supply chain optimisation."

If you cannot explain the business in one sentence to a non-finance audience, the retail narrative needs work.

### Sharia Compliance

This is critical for Saudi retail participation. Research indicates that approximately 78% of Saudi retail investors prefer Sharia-compliant equities, and Sharia certification can multiply retail subscription rates three to five times.

**Sharia compliance criteria:**
- Revenue from permissible activities (no alcohol, gambling, or conventional interest as a primary revenue source)
- Debt-to-market-cap below 33%
- Cash plus interest-bearing securities below 33% of assets
- Accounts receivable below 45% of assets

For consumer-facing companies targeting broad retail participation, obtaining a Sharia compliance certification from reputable scholars twelve months before the IPO is a meaningful demand catalyst.

### Minimum Investment Threshold

Retail investors face capital constraints and accessibility barriers.

- SAR 500–1,000 minimum investment (SAR 30–60 per share) → mass market participation
- SAR 2,000+ minimum → excludes smaller retail investors

### Expectation of a Positive First Day

Retail investors tend to respond to perceived pricing conservatism — the sense that there is room for a first-day gain. When pricing is perceived as aggressive, retail enthusiasm softens. When pricing appears conservative (and recent comparable deals have performed well), subscription rates rise.

## Strategies to Maximise Oversubscription

### For Institutional Oversubscription

**Price 15–20% below peer multiples:** This is the single highest-impact lever. A defensible discount to comparable companies creates the re-rating narrative institutions use to justify positions.

**Emphasise growth differential:** Revenue and EBITDA CAGR versus sector peers. Growth investors specifically seek companies where the growth premium appears underrepresented in the offer price.

**Secure anchor investors pre-launch:** Committing 30–40% of the institutional tranche to anchor investors before formal book-building signals demand quality. Remaining institutions take comfort from anchor commitments.

**Maintain 30%+ free float:** Exceeds the minimum and signals institutional liquidity confidence. Removes the five to eight percentage point discount that thinner floats carry.

**Structure 24-month lock-ups:** Staggered, long lock-ups eliminate supply overhang concerns. This is particularly important for TASI names where institutional positions are large.

### For Retail Oversubscription

**Build brand awareness three to six months pre-IPO:** Media presence, social media engagement, community communication. Retail awareness translates directly into subscription rates.

**Obtain Sharia compliance certification early:** Engage reputable scholars twelve months before the IPO. A prominent Sharia compliance certification in the prospectus is one of the highest-ROI preparation steps for consumer-facing companies.

**Simplify the equity story:** One sentence, two at most. Test it on non-finance colleagues. If they don't immediately understand the business and the growth angle, refine it.

**Price shares for accessibility:** Target SAR 30–60 per share — putting the minimum investment within reach of the mass market.

**Align with Vision 2030 narrative:** Healthcare, tourism, logistics, and entertainment resonate particularly strongly with retail investors who follow national transformation themes.

## Managing the Allocation Challenge

High oversubscription creates difficult allocation decisions that can affect the aftermarket if handled poorly.

### Institutional Allocation

Pro-rata allocation adjusted for:
- **Anchor investors:** Pre-committed allocations, guaranteed position
- **Long-term holders:** Premium allocation for investors with demonstrably long holding periods
- **Known short-term traders:** Minimal allocation (aftermarket stability interest)

This is not purely mathematical — it reflects relationship management and aftermarket stability objectives.

### Retail Allocation

Pure pro-rata: if 4x oversubscribed, each subscriber receives 25% of their subscription amount. No discretion applied. Refunds processed within two to three days.

### The Underallocation Problem

High oversubscription means frustrated investors who wanted more than they received. The solution is pricing: a 5–10% first-day gain allows underallocated retail investors to feel satisfied by the immediate appreciation, rather than rushing to sell on day one to "lock in" whatever gain they can access.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Oversubscription is relative to offer size:** 450x on a SAR 346M Nomu deal is not directly comparable to 100x on a SAR 4B TASI deal — the demand amounts are very different
2. **Optimal range:** 30–80x institutional, 300–600% retail, first-day return 5–10%
3. **Extreme oversubscription can mean underpricing:** Above 200x institutional often signals the company could have priced higher
4. **2025 demand leaders:** Saudi Parts (241x), Fakeeh Care (162x), Flynas (100x institutional, 350% retail) — driven by brand recognition, defensive sectors, Vision 2030 alignment
5. **CMA's 30% retail guidance:** October 2025 — companies now need a genuine retail story, not just an institutional investment case
6. **Sharia compliance impact:** Three to five times more retail subscriptions for compliant companies — critical for consumer-facing IPOs
7. **Institutional drivers:** 15–20% discount to peer multiples, growth-to-multiple ratio, 30%+ free float, 24-month lock-ups, sector momentum
8. **Retail drivers:** Brand recognition, simplicity of story, Sharia compliance, accessible price point, perceived pricing conservatism
9. **Allocation strategy:** Institutional allocation rewards long-term holders; retail is pure pro-rata — manage the underallocation frustration through pricing
10. **Sequencing:** Build brand 3–6 months pre-IPO → Sharia certification → price conservatively → target 30–80x institutional demand → allocate strategically
