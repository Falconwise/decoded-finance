# WACC in Saudi Arabia: Zakat Treatment and Cost of Capital Mechanics

Saudi valuations often go wrong for one simple reason. Analysts import a textbook WACC and apply it to SAR cash flows without adjusting for local mechanics.

This post lays out a practical, audit-friendly WACC workflow for Saudi companies. The goal is not a single perfect number. The goal is a WACC that is internally consistent, explainable to a CFO, and easy to sensitize.

## 1) The core definition
Weighted Average Cost of Capital is the blended required return demanded by all capital providers.

$$WACC = w_e K_e + w_d K_d$$

Where:
- $w_e$, $w_d$ are market value weights of equity and debt
- $K_e$ is cost of equity
- $K_d$ is cost of debt (after-tax only when a tax shield is available)

## 2) Step-by-step WACC workflow for Saudi companies

### Step A. Pick the valuation currency first
If your cash flows are in SAR, your WACC inputs should be SAR-consistent.
- Risk-free rate must be SAR-based.
- Country risk adjustments must not be double-counted.
- Inflation and growth assumptions should match the currency.

If you are valuing in USD, you can still do it, but then your cash flows, discount rate, and terminal growth must all be USD-consistent.

### Step B. Estimate the SAR risk-free rate
Two defensible approaches:
1) Direct SAR government yield (when a reliable liquid benchmark is available).
2) Build-up using the peg: start with a USD risk-free rate and add a Saudi default spread proxy.

A clean build-up expression is:

$$R_{f,SAR} = R_{f,USD} + CDS_{KSA}$$

Use the same tenor for $R_f$ and the sovereign spread. Keep the inputs clearly labeled as illustrative if you are not using a live market feed.

### Step C. Build cost of equity using CAPM, then sanity-check it
Baseline CAPM:

$$K_e = R_f + \beta \cdot ERP$$

In practice, you should document:
- Risk-free rate source and tenor
- Beta method (regression beta, adjusted beta, or bottom-up beta)
- Equity risk premium construction (global ERP, plus any country risk component if used)

**Sanity checks that stay educational:**
- Compare $K_e$ to a dividend yield plus a conservative long-run growth rate (a pricing cross-check).
- Compare $K_e$ to a reasonable range for the sector and size, then explain the drivers.

### Step D. Estimate cost of debt from observable pricing or a synthetic rating
Two approaches:
1) Observable pricing: use latest facility pricing, sukuk yield, or spreads over SAIBOR.
2) Synthetic rating: map financial ratios to a rating band, then apply a spread range.

Keep $K_d$ as the current marginal borrowing rate, not the historical average cost.

### Step E. Handle Zakat vs tax consistently
This is where Saudi WACC often breaks.

If the company is primarily a Zakat payer, interest expense typically does not create the same conventional corporate income tax shield that the textbook formula assumes. In that case, treating $K_d$ as $K_d(1-t)$ can understate WACC.

Operational rule of thumb for modeling:
- Income tax payer: use after-tax cost of debt, $K_d(1-t)$.
- Zakat payer: use pre-tax cost of debt as a conservative default unless you have a clearly documented tax shield mechanism.

If the entity is mixed (part Zakat, part tax), apply a weighted approach consistent with its effective structure.

### Step F. Use market value weights, and document approximations
Equity weight:
$$w_e = \frac{E}{D+E}$$

Debt weight:
$$w_d = \frac{D}{D+E}$$

Where:
- $E$ is market cap (or a defensible private valuation proxy)
- $D$ is market value of interest-bearing debt (often approximated with book value if close to par)

## 3) Worked example (illustrative numbers)
Assume:
- SAR risk-free rate: 5.5%
- ERP: 6.0%
- Beta: 1.1
- Cost of debt (marginal): 7.0%
- Market values: $E = 1,000$, $D = 500$ (SAR millions)

Cost of equity:
$$K_e = 5.5\% + 1.1 \times 6.0\% = 12.1\%$$

Weights:
- $w_e = 1,000 / 1,500 = 66.7\%$
- $w_d = 500 / 1,500 = 33.3\%$

If Zakat payer (no conventional tax shield assumed):
$$WACC = 0.667 \times 12.1\% + 0.333 \times 7.0\% = 10.4\%$$

If income tax payer with $t = 20\%$:
$$WACC = 0.667 \times 12.1\% + 0.333 \times 7.0\% \times (1-0.20) = 9.9\%$$

The point is not the decimal. The point is to show clearly why the tax treatment assumption matters.

## 4) Integrity checklist before you publish a number
1) Currency consistency: SAR cash flows and SAR $R_f$ match.
2) No double counting: if you add a country risk premium in ERP, do not also add it elsewhere.
3) Debt pricing realism: $K_d$ reflects current marginal cost, not last year’s average.
4) Zakat and tax treatment stated plainly: one sentence in the assumption box.
5) Sensitivity table included: WACC plus or minus 0.5% and plus or minus 1.0% with valuation impact.
