# Beta for Tadawul Companies: Regression Limits, Adjustments, and Bottom-Up Alternatives

Beta is an estimate of how a stock co-moves with the market. In Saudi markets, beta estimation can be noisy due to liquidity differences, float effects, and regime shifts.

The goal is to choose a method that is defensible for the valuation use case.

## 1) Beta inside CAPM
$$K_e = R_f + \beta \cdot ERP$$

Beta is a multiplier. If it is unstable, $K_e$ becomes unstable, and valuation inherits that noise.

## 2) Why simple regression beta can be unstable
Regression beta may be unreliable when:
- trading is thin
- the company has structural changes in leverage or business mix
- price moves reflect liquidity shocks rather than fundamentals

This does not mean regression beta is always wrong. It means you should test stability and use alternatives when needed.

## 3) Practical regression hygiene
- test multiple windows (2-year, 5-year)
- compare daily vs weekly returns for thinly traded names
- consider an adjusted beta if the raw regression is extreme

Document the choice and show a beta sensitivity.

## 4) Leverage adjustment and the tax assumption
Unlever and relever betas:

$$\beta_u = \frac{\beta_l}{1 + (1-t) \cdot (D/E)}$$
$$\beta_l = \beta_u \cdot \left(1 + (1-t) \cdot (D/E)\right)$$

For a conservative approach on Zakat payers, do not assume a conventional interest tax shield unless clearly documented. Set $t = 0$ in the relevering step unless you have a justified alternative.

## 5) Bottom-up beta workflow
1) select a peer set by business risk
2) unlever peer betas
3) take a median $\beta_u$
4) relever using target leverage

Bottom-up beta is often more stable than regression beta for decision-grade valuation.

## 6) Example (illustrative)
Assume $\beta_u = 0.9$, target $D/E = 0.5$, and $t = 0$.
$$\beta_l = 0.9 \times (1 + 0.5) = 1.35$$
