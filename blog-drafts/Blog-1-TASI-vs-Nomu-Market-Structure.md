## Introduction

Saudi Arabia's capital markets have emerged as one of the most dynamic IPO destinations globally, with 126 companies raising over SAR 80 billion between 2021 and 2025. Yet many corporate finance professionals still struggle with a fundamental question: **Should we list on TASI or Nomu?**

This isn't just a regulatory checkbox—it's a strategic decision that impacts your valuation, cost structure, investor access, and long-term capital markets trajectory. The wrong choice can leave tens of millions of riyals in value on the table.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll decode the two-tier market structure that defines Saudi Arabia's capital markets, examine real performance data from recent IPOs, and provide a practical framework for determining your optimal listing venue.

## The Two-Tier Market Structure: A Strategic Design

Saudi Arabia operates a deliberately bifurcated capital market system, each tier serving distinct company profiles and investor bases.

### TASI (Tadawul All Share Index) - The Main Market

**Market Positioning:** TASI serves as the primary listing venue for mature, established companies with proven track records and substantial capital requirements.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Minimum market capitalization:** SAR 300 million (though SAR 500M+ more typical)
- **Average IPO size (2025):** SAR 1,115 million
- **Annual listing volume:** 13-14 IPOs (2024-2025)
- **Total market capitalization:** SAR 9.56 trillion (January 2026)
- **Investor access:** Universal—retail, institutional, and foreign investors

**Typical TASI Profile:**
- Market cap exceeding SAR 500 million
- 3+ years of audited financials with consistent profitability
- Established operations in mature industries
- Capital needs exceeding SAR 300 million
- Ready to meet stringent governance requirements

**2024-2025 TASI Highlights:**
- Flynas (Aviation): SAR 4.1B—first Gulf airline IPO in 20 years
- Fakeeh Care (Healthcare): SAR 2.9B
- Saudi Parts Store (Consumer): SAR 1.96B
- Al Baha Investment (Financial Services): SAR 1.88B
- Alramz (Retail): SAR 1.5B

These aren't startups testing the waters—they're established market leaders seeking growth capital at scale.

### Nomu (Parallel Market) - The Growth Stage Venue

**Market Positioning:** Nomu caters to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), growth-stage companies, and founder-led businesses that need public market access without the full regulatory burden of TASI.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Minimum market capitalization:** SAR 10 million (SAR 100M+ more realistic)
- **Average IPO size (2025):** SAR 53 million
- **Annual listing volume:** 24-28 IPOs (2024-2025)
- **Total market capitalization:** SAR 40.5 billion (January 2026)
- **Investor access:** Qualified investors only (pre-listing), universal post-listing

**Typical Nomu Profile:**
- Market cap between SAR 50-300 million
- 2+ years of audited financials (profitability not mandatory)
- Emerging business models in scaling phase
- Capital needs SAR 30-200 million
- Prefer lighter compliance burden and lower costs

**2024-2025 Nomu Highlights:**
- Alwazn Almithaly (Consumer Goods): SAR 346M
- Tharwah (Logistics): SAR 372M
- Arabica Star (Consumer Goods): SAR 230M
- Khaldi Logistics: SAR 75M
- RATIO (Industrial): SAR 50M

Nomu companies are building track records, proving concepts, and establishing market presence before potentially graduating to TASI.

## The Numbers Tell the Story: Market Comparison

Let's quantify the differences with 2024-2025 performance data:

| Metric | TASI (Main Market) | Nomu (Parallel Market) | Ratio |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Average IPO Size** | SAR 1,115M | SAR 53M | 21:1 |
| **Annual Listings** | 13-14 | 24-28 | 1:2 |
| **Total Market Cap** | SAR 9.56T | SAR 40.5B | 236:1 |
| **Avg Daily Volume** | SAR 12-45M | SAR 0.8-3M | 15:1 |
| **Min Market Cap** | SAR 300M | SAR 10M | 30:1 |
| **Free Float Requirement** | 30% | 20% | 1.5:1 |
| **Institutional Oversubscription** | 80-150x typical | 150-500x typical | Higher on Nomu |
| **Foreign Ownership (2025)** | 4.87% (SAR 466B) | 1.49% (SAR 0.6B) | 3.3:1 |

**Key Insight:** TASI dominates by market cap and transaction size, but Nomu processes nearly 2x the number of listings annually. This reflects Nomu's role as an entry point for emerging companies.

## The Graduation Pathway: Nomu to TASI

One of the most strategic aspects of Saudi Arabia's two-tier system is the **graduation mechanism**—successful Nomu companies can transfer to TASI once they meet eligibility criteria.

### Transfer Requirements:
- **Minimum 2 years** listed on Nomu
- **SAR 200M average market cap** during 6 months preceding application (lower than TASI's SAR 300M standard threshold)
- Meet all TASI governance and disclosure standards
- Board approval and public disclosure mandatory

### Recent Graduation Success Stories (2024-2026):
- **Saudi Azm** (2025): +25% in first 6 months post-transfer
- **Obeikan Glass** (July 2025)
- **Nofoth Food Products** (January 2026): Expected 33-63% re-rating
- **Alwasail** (January 2026)

**Historical Performance:** 21 companies have successfully graduated from Nomu to TASI as of January 2026, with an average **15-22% valuation lift** within 6-12 months post-transfer.

This graduation pathway transforms Nomu from merely a "smaller exchange" into a **strategic stepping stone** for mid-cap companies with growth ambitions.

## Market Performance: How Did 2025 Treat Each Market?

The 2025 performance divergence reveals critical insights about market structure and liquidity dynamics.

### TASI Performance (2025):
- **Index return:** -6.8% (January-December 2025)
- **IPO cohort 6-month performance:** +4.2% average
- **Outperformance:** IPOs beat index by 11 percentage points
- **Trading above offer (6 months):** 65% of 2025 cohort

### Nomu Performance (2025):
- **NomuC Index return:** -26% (January-December 2025)
- **IPO cohort 6-month performance:** -15% average
- **Underperformance:** Less severe than index but still negative
- **Trading above offer (6 months):** 42% of 2024-2025 cohort

**Critical Observation:** During market stress, Nomu's illiquidity amplified downside—the index fell **3.8x worse** than TASI (-26% vs -6.8%). This liquidity risk is a core consideration in venue selection.

---

## Investor Demand: The Oversubscription Phenomenon

Saudi IPOs consistently generate exceptional oversubscription rates, but the dynamics differ by market.

### 2025 Oversubscription Leaders:

**TASI:**
- Saudi Parts Store: 241x institutional
- Fakeeh Care: 162x institutional
- Flynas: 100x institutional, 350% retail (SAR 400-600B total demand)

**Nomu:**
- Khaldi Logistics: 1,949% (19.5x)
- Alwazn Almithaly: 450x institutional
- RATIO: 865% (8.65x)
- Arabica Star: 208x institutional

**Typical Ranges:**
- TASI institutional: 80-150x
- Nomu institutional: 150-500x
- TASI retail: 200-400%

**Why Higher Oversubscription on Nomu?**
Lower offer sizes mean institutional investors can deploy full allocation appetites on smaller capital bases, creating disproportionate oversubscription multiples. A SAR 50M Nomu offering can see 500x oversubscription because institutional investors are bidding SAR 25B+ for limited shares.

## Regulatory Framework: What Changes in October 2025

The Saudi Capital Market Authority (CMA) introduced **significant guidance in October 2025** that affects both markets:

### 30% Retail Allocation Guideline

**Previous practice:** Institutional investors dominated allocations (70-80% of shares)

**New CMA guidance:** Issuers encouraged to allocate approximately **30% to retail investors**

**Strategic Impact:**
- Companies must build **retail brand appeal**, not just institutional investment stories
- Consumer-facing businesses gain advantage (direct customer-shareholder alignment)
- Retail oversubscription becomes stronger market confidence signal
- Broader shareholder base improves aftermarket liquidity

This shift favors companies with **strong brand recognition and consumer touchpoints**—think retail, healthcare, aviation, and consumer goods over industrial B2B players.

---

## Foreign Investment: The February 2026 Game-Changer

Effective **February 1, 2026**, the CMA implemented full market liberalization that fundamentally reshapes TASI's value proposition.

### What Changed:
- **Elimination of QFI (Qualified Foreign Investor) concept**
- **Direct foreign investment access** to TASI Main Market
- **Simplified account opening** for non-residents
- **Nomu remains qualified investor-only** (foreigners must still meet Saudi qualified investor criteria)

### Current Foreign Ownership:
- **TASI:** 4.87% foreign ownership (SAR 466B of SAR 9.56T market cap)
- **Nomu:** 1.49% foreign ownership (SAR 0.6B of SAR 40.5B market cap)

### Expected Impact:
- TASI foreign ownership projected to reach **8-12% within 2 years**
- **+5-8% valuation boost** for TASI-listed companies in internationally attractive sectors
- **TASI premium widens** by an additional 3-5 percentage points over Nomu

**Strategic Takeaway:** Companies targeting global institutional capital now have **dramatically improved access via TASI**, while Nomu remains predominantly domestic-focused.

## Cost Structure: The Economic Reality

IPO costs are not trivial, and they scale differently by market.

### All-In IPO Costs (% of Offer Size):

| Cost Category | TASI | Nomu |
|--------------|------|------|
| Underwriting fees | 1.5-2.5% | 2.5-4.0% |
| Legal & advisory | 0.5-1.0% | 1.0-2.0% |
| Audit & due diligence | 0.3-0.8% | 0.5-1.5% |
| Marketing & roadshow | 0.2-0.5% | 0.3-0.8% |
| Regulatory & listing fees | 0.2-0.4% | 0.3-0.6% |
| **Total Range** | **2.7-5.2%** | **4.6-8.9%** |

### Absolute Cost Examples:
- **SAR 1 billion TASI IPO:** SAR 27-52 million in costs
- **SAR 50 million Nomu IPO:** SAR 2.3-4.45 million in costs

**Fixed Cost Floor:** Regardless of deal size, expect minimum SAR 3-5 million in professional fees. This is why offerings below SAR 30M are rarely economical.

**Why Nomu Costs More (Percentage-Wise):**
- Smaller deal sizes spread fixed costs over smaller base
- Higher perceived execution risk requires premium fees
- Limited fee negotiating leverage for smaller issuers
- Underwriters require higher compensation for illiquid aftermarket support

## Decision Framework: Which Market Is Right for Your Company?

Use this practical checklist to assess your optimal listing venue:

### Choose TASI If:
✅ Current/projected market cap **>SAR 500 million**  
✅ **3+ years audited financials** with consistent profitability  
✅ Need to raise **>SAR 300 million** in single offering  
✅ Seeking **maximum institutional and foreign investor access**  
✅ Ready for **stringent governance** (independent directors, audit committees)  
✅ **Consumer brand** with strong retail appeal  
✅ Vision 2030-aligned sector (tourism, healthcare, logistics, entertainment)

### Choose Nomu If:
✅ Current market cap **SAR 50-300 million**  
✅ **2 years audited financials**; profitability not yet mandatory  
✅ Need to raise **SAR 30-200 million**  
✅ Prefer **lighter compliance burden** and lower ongoing costs  
✅ Plan to **graduate to TASI within 2-3 years** (stepping stone strategy)  
✅ **Growth-stage company** building public market track record  
✅ Institutional-focused investor base acceptable initially

### The Hybrid Strategy: Nomu as Stepping Stone

For companies with **SAR 150-400M market cap**, consider the graduation pathway:

**Year 1:** List on Nomu (20% float, SAR 40M raise, lighter governance)  
**Year 2-3:** Execute growth plan, build public market credibility  
**Year 3:** Graduate to TASI (no new offering required)  
**Year 4:** Secondary offering on TASI at higher valuation (capture re-rating)

This approach can maximize **total capital raised over 3-5 years** while managing compliance costs during growth phase.

---

## Timing Considerations: When to Launch

Market timing affects success rates regardless of venue choice.

### Optimal IPO Windows (Historical Data):

**Q1 (January-March):**
- Strong momentum period
- 5-8 IPOs typically launched
- Post-holiday institutional liquidity

**Q2 (April-June):**
- **Peak season** (35% of 2025 deals)
- Flynas and major TASI deals priced May-June 2025
- Maximum institutional attention

**Q3 (July-September):**
- Moderate activity
- **Ramadan considerations** (retail participation drops)
- Summer vacation impact on investor availability

**Q4 (October-December):**
- Year-end rush
- Companies racing to meet calendar-year targets
- Budget allocation deadlines for institutions

**Strategic Recommendation:** Target **Q2 or early Q4** for maximum institutional liquidity. Avoid Ramadan period if retail allocation is critical to your equity story.

## Key Takeaways: Your Venue Selection Summary

1. **Size Matters Most:** Market cap <SAR 300M → Nomu; >SAR 500M → TASI is the primary determinant

2. **Liquidity Is Structural:** TASI's 15-30x higher trading volumes translate to 15-35% valuation premium over comparable Nomu peers

3. **Graduation Is Real:** 21 companies successfully transferred Nomu → TASI, averaging 15-22% valuation lift within 6-12 months

4. **2025 Stress Test:** Nomu fell 3.8x worse than TASI during market decline (-26% vs -6.8%), revealing downside amplification from illiquidity

5. **Foreign Access Matters:** Feb 2026 liberalization gives TASI direct global institutional access while Nomu remains domestic-focused

6. **Cost Structure:** Nomu costs 2-4 percentage points more as % of offer size, but absolute costs lower for smaller deals

7. **Retail Shift:** CMA's 30% allocation guidance (Oct 2025) favors consumer brands and companies with retail appeal

8. **The Stepping Stone Works:** For SAR 150-400M companies, Nomu → TASI graduation can maximize total capital raised over 3-5 years
