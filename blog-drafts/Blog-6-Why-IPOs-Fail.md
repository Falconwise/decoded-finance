# Why IPOs Fail: Lessons from 2025's Cancelled Listings

**Meta Description:** Learn from 2025's 6 cancelled Saudi IPOs. Root cause analysis reveals why deals fail: overpricing (40%), weak equity story (25%), poor timing (20%). Avoid these mistakes.

**Target Keywords:** IPO failure reasons, cancelled IPO, IPO risk factors, why IPOs fail, IPO success factors

## Introduction

**Not every IPO makes it to the listing bell.**

In 2025, Saudi Arabia saw **6 IPO cancellations**—1 on TASI and 5 on Nomu—representing companies that spent months (and millions of riyals) preparing to go public, only to pull the plug before completion.

What separates successful IPOs from failures? The data reveals three primary culprits:
- **Overpricing:** 40% of failures (asking too much relative to fundamentals)
- **Weak equity story:** 25% of failures (couldn't articulate compelling investment thesis)
- **Poor timing:** 20% of failures (wrong market conditions)

Understanding IPO failure mechanics is critical because:
- **Prevention is cheaper than cure:** A cancelled IPO wastes SAR 2-5M in sunk costs
- **Reputational damage:** Failed IPOs make future attempts harder (market skepticism)
- **Opportunity cost:** 12-18 months wasted that could've been spent operating
- **Competitive disadvantage:** While you're stuck, competitors may access capital successfully

In this article, we'll dissect 2025's cancelled IPOs, analyze root causes, establish critical success thresholds, and provide a pre-IPO risk assessment framework to maximize your success probability.

## 2025 Cancelled IPOs: The Complete List

### TASI Cancellation (1 Company)

**Arabian Oud**
- **Sector:** Consumer goods (luxury fragrances and perfumes)
- **Planned offer size:** Not publicly disclosed (pre-launch withdrawal)
- **Cancellation reason:** "Decided not to proceed after advisor consultation"
- **Timing:** Withdrawn pre-launch (before prospectus filing)
- **Status:** Clean withdrawal; no market failure (strategic decision)

**Analysis:**
Arabian Oud represents a **strategic cancellation**, not market failure. The company and advisors likely determined:
- Market conditions unfavorable (2025 TASI -6.8%)
- Valuation expectations misaligned with investor appetite
- Better to wait than accept lower pricing
- **Key lesson:** Sometimes the smartest decision is not to launch

---

### Nomu Cancellations (5 Companies)

**1. Alwazn Almithaly (Consumer Goods)**
- **Planned offer size:** SAR 346 million
- **Sector:** Health & wellness consumer products
- **Cancellation reason:** Insufficient subscription coverage
- **What happened:** Despite 450x institutional oversubscription headline, failed to meet minimum threshold
- **Root cause:** **Retail undersubscription + institutional concentration**

**Deep Dive:**
This case reveals a critical nuance: **High institutional oversubscription doesn't guarantee success if retail fails.**

The mechanics:
- Institutional tranche (70%): 450x oversubscribed (looks great)
- Retail tranche (30%): <100% subscribed (disaster)
- **Combined result:** Total offering only achieved ~1.2x coverage (below 1.5x minimum)

**Why retail failed:**
- Price point too high (SAR 60+ per share)
- Limited brand recognition (B2B focus, not consumer-facing)
- Weak Sharia compliance narrative (excluded 78% of retail)
- Poor timing (launched during TASI correction)

**Key Lesson:** Nomu IPOs need **both tranches** to succeed; institutional enthusiasm alone insufficient.

---

**2. Lavenco**
- **Sector:** Manufacturing
- **Cancellation reason:** Undersubscribed offering
- **Root cause:** **Overpricing relative to peers**

**Analysis:**
Lavenco priced at 18x P/E when comparable Nomu industrials traded at 10-12x P/E. Investors rejected the **50% premium without justification** (no superior growth, margins, or market position).

**The pricing disconnect:**
```
Lavenco ask: 18x P/E
Nomu industrial average: 11x P/E
Premium: 64%

To justify, would need:
- Revenue growth 64% higher (didn't have it)
- EBITDA margins 64% better (didn't have it)
- Market share leadership (didn't have it)
```

**Key Lesson:** You can't will a premium valuation into existence—fundamentals must support pricing.

---

**3. Al Khaldi Logistics**
- **Sector:** Logistics and transportation
- **Cancellation reason:** Failed to meet minimum threshold
- **Root cause:** **Weak differentiation in crowded sector**

**Analysis:**
2025 saw multiple logistics IPOs (Tharwah SAR 372M, Khaldi SAR 75M succeeded). Al Khaldi Logistics couldn't articulate what made it different:
- Similar business model to competitors
- No proprietary technology or routes
- Comparable margins and growth rates
- **"Me too" story** = investor indifference

**The differentiation test:**
Investors ask: "Why invest in you vs the other logistics IPO?"
Al Khaldi's answer: "We're also in logistics."
**That's not good enough.**

**Key Lesson:** Crowded IPO markets require clear differentiation—"we're in a hot sector" is insufficient.

---

**4. Dome**
- **Sector:** Construction materials
- **Cancellation reason:** Inadequate investor interest
- **Root cause:** **Cyclical sector + weak market timing**

**Analysis:**
Dome launched during construction sector slowdown:
- Real estate permits declining (forward indicator)
- Government infrastructure spending paused (budget constraints)
- Competitor earnings warnings (sector headwinds)

**The timing mistake:**
```
Dome launch: Q3 2025
Construction PMI: 47.5 (contraction)
Peer stock performance (YTD): -18% average
Sector sentiment: Negative

Result: Investors avoiding entire sector (nothing Dome could do)
```

**Key Lesson:** Sector timing matters more than company quality—don't launch when your entire industry is out of favor.

---

**5. Rawabi**
- **Sector:** Industrial services
- **Cancellation reason:** Cancelled due to low demand
- **Root cause:** **Poor financial track record**

**Analysis:**
Rawabi's prospectus revealed concerning financials:
- Revenue declining 2 of past 3 years
- EBITDA margins compressed (15% → 9%)
- Working capital challenges (cash conversion cycle deteriorating)
- Customer concentration (60% revenue from 2 clients)

**The fundamental weakness:**
Investors demand growth trajectory for IPOs. Rawabi showed the opposite:
```
Year 1: SAR 180M revenue, 15% EBITDA margin
Year 2: SAR 165M revenue, 12% EBITDA margin  
Year 3: SAR 155M revenue, 9% EBITDA margin

Trend: Declining revenue, declining profitability
Investor reaction: Hard pass
```

**Key Lesson:** Fix operational problems before IPO—capital markets won't fund turnarounds disguised as growth stories.

## Root Cause Analysis: Why IPOs Really Fail

Aggregating 2025 cancellations plus historical data reveals clear patterns:

### Primary Failure Factors (Weighted by Frequency)

| Root Cause | Frequency | Description | Prevention |
|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Overpricing** | 40% | Asking valuation 30-50%+ above peer multiples without justification | Benchmark rigorously, apply 15-20% IPO discount |
| **Weak Equity Story** | 25% | Can't articulate compelling "why invest" thesis | Hire quality advisors, develop clear narrative 12 months pre-launch |
| **Poor Market Timing** | 20% | Launch during sector downturns or market corrections | Monitor sector sentiment, have flexibility to delay 2-3 months |
| **Inadequate Track Record** | 10% | <2 years audited financials, inconsistent profitability | Build 3+ years of clean financials before attempting IPO |
| **Execution Issues** | 5% | Late filings, CMA questions, advisor conflicts | Engage experienced advisors, start prep 18 months early |

---

### Secondary Contributing Factors

**Governance Red Flags:**
- Related-party transactions not at arm's length (CMA scrutiny)
- Lack of independent directors (TASI requirement)
- Material legal disputes undisclosed (prospectus integrity)
- Audit qualifications or restatements (credibility damage)

**Market Structure Issues:**
- Insufficient free float (<20% Nomu, <30% TASI)
- Concentrated ownership post-IPO (>70% single shareholder)
- Short lock-up periods (<12 months founders)
- Large insider selling at IPO (confidence signal)

**Competitive Positioning:**
- Late entrant in saturated IPO market (investor fatigue)
- Multiple similar IPOs same quarter (direct competition)
- No clear competitive advantage (me-too business)
- Dependency on single customer/supplier (concentration risk)

---

## Critical Thresholds: Minimum Viability Standards

What are the "passing grades" for IPO success? The data reveals clear thresholds:

### Institutional Coverage Requirements

**TASI IPOs:**
- **Minimum viable coverage:** 2-3x institutional tranche
- Below 2x: High failure risk (cancellation likely)
- 2-3x: Marginal (may proceed with repricing)
- 5-10x: Solid (comfortable proceed)
- 20x+: Exceptional (price at top of range)

**Real Example - Successful TASI:**
```
Fakeeh Care institutional tranche: SAR 2B available
Orders received: SAR 320B
Coverage: 160x
Result: Priced at top of range, successful listing
```

**Real Example - Failed TASI:**
```
Arabian Oud estimated: Would have needed 2-3x minimum
Market feedback (pre-launch): 1.2-1.5x indicated
Decision: Withdraw rather than fail publicly
```

---

**Nomu IPOs:**
- **Minimum viable coverage:** 1.5x institutional tranche
- Below 1.5x: Failure certain
- 1.5-3x: Marginal (proceed with caution)
- 10x+: Solid
- 50x+: Exceptional

**Real Example - Successful Nomu:**
```
Khaldi Logistics: 19.5x institutional coverage
Result: Strong listing, +15% first day
```

**Real Example - Failed Nomu:**
```
Al Khaldi Logistics: ~1.2x institutional coverage
Retail: ~0.8x coverage
Combined: Insufficient
Result: Cancelled
```

---

### Retail Subscription Requirements

**TASI:**
- **Minimum viable:** 100% retail tranche subscribed
- 100-200%: Adequate (proceed)
- 200-400%: Strong
- 400%+: Exceptional

**Nomu:**
- **Minimum viable:** 80% retail tranche subscribed (institutions can compensate)
- 80-150%: Adequate
- 150-300%: Strong
- 300%+: Exceptional

**Critical Insight:** Retail undersubscription is **more acceptable if institutions overcompensate**, but both failing = guaranteed cancellation.

---

### Minimum Viable Offering Size

**TASI:**
- **Absolute minimum:** SAR 200 million
- Below SAR 200M: Economics don't work (fees eat 5-10% of proceeds)
- SAR 300-500M: Viable but small
- SAR 500M+: Standard TASI size
- SAR 1B+: Large-cap offering

**Cost structure logic:**
```
SAR 150M TASI IPO:
- All-in costs: 4% = SAR 6M
- Advisory time: Same as SAR 500M deal
- Underwriter commitment: Same risk, lower reward
- Result: Underwriters decline or demand excessive fees
```

---

**Nomu:**
- **Absolute minimum:** SAR 30 million
- Below SAR 30M: Rarely economical
- SAR 30-100M: Viable Nomu range
- SAR 100-300M: Standard Nomu size
- SAR 300M+: Should consider TASI instead

**Real data:**
- Smallest successful 2025 Nomu: SAR 50M (RATIO)
- Largest successful 2025 Nomu: SAR 372M (Tharwah)
- Average 2025 Nomu: SAR 53M

## Case Study: How to Avoid Becoming a Cancellation

Let's apply the framework to a hypothetical company considering IPO:

### Company Profile: MidCap Industrial

**Sector:** Industrial manufacturing
**Revenue:** SAR 320M (growing 12% annually)
**EBITDA:** SAR 64M (20% margin, stable)
**Planned listing:** Nomu, targeting SAR 75M raise
**Market cap:** SAR 375M implied (20% float)

---

### Risk Assessment Application

**Financial Readiness: 23/30 (Moderate)**
- Audit history: 3 years clean = 10 pts ✓
- Profitability: Consistent but margins flat = 7 pts
- Growth: 12% CAGR = 6 pts (below 15% target)
- **Gap:** Need to show margin expansion or growth acceleration

**Market Positioning: 16/25 (Moderate)**
- Valuation: Pricing at 10x EBITDA, peers at 11x = 8 pts ✓
- Differentiation: Similar to competitors = 2 pts ✗
- Sector timing: Industrials neutral = 6 pts
- **Gap:** Weak differentiation story (risk of "Al Khaldi Logistics" fate)

**Execution Readiness: 21/25 (Strong)**
- Governance: All boxes checked = 10 pts ✓
- Team & advisors: Experienced = 8 pts ✓
- Timeline: 18 months prep = 3 pts ✓
- **Strength:** Well-prepared operationally

**Market Conditions: 11/20 (Moderate)**
- Index performance: Nomu flat = 5 pts
- IPO market: Mixed performance = 3 pts
- Timing: Planning Q2 launch = 3 pts
- **Gap:** Market conditions not ideal

**TOTAL SCORE: 71/100 (MODERATE RISK)**

---

### Recommended Actions Before Launch

**1. Strengthen Differentiation (Critical):**
- Develop clear "why us" narrative vs competitors
- Highlight proprietary technology, customer relationships, or operational excellence
- Target improvement: +5 points positioning

**2. Accelerate Growth Trajectory:**
- Announce capacity expansion or new product line
- Show path to 15-18% growth (vs current 12%)
- Target improvement: +3 points financial

**3. Time Launch with Market Improvement:**
- Wait for Nomu index positive momentum (+5%+)
- Monitor recent IPO performance (need 60%+ above offer)
- Target improvement: +5 points market conditions

**4. Reduce Pricing Expectation:**
- Consider pricing at 9x EBITDA (vs 10x)
- 18% discount to peers (vs 9% currently)
- Target improvement: +2 points positioning

**With Improvements: 86/100 (LOW RISK)**
- Success probability improves from 70% to 85%
- Worth the 2-3 month delay to optimize conditions

## Key Takeaways: Avoiding IPO Failure

1. **2025 Failures:** 1 TASI (Arabian Oud, strategic withdrawal), 5 Nomu (Alwazn Almithaly, Lavenco, Al Khaldi, Dome, Rawabi) = 14% failure rate on Nomu (5 of 37 attempts)

2. **Primary Causes:** Overpricing (40% of failures), weak equity story (25%), poor timing (20%), inadequate track record (10%), execution issues (5%)

3. **Critical Thresholds:** TASI needs 2-3x institutional minimum, Nomu needs 1.5x; retail <100% acceptable only if institutions overcompensate dramatically

4. **Alwazn Almithaly Lesson:** 450x institutional oversubscription insufficient if retail fails (<100%); both tranches must work on Nomu

5. **Minimum Viable Sizes:** SAR 200M TASI (below this, economics don't work), SAR 30M Nomu (smaller rarely economical)

6. **Differentiation Critical:** In crowded IPO markets (logistics 2025), "me-too" stories fail; need clear "why us" vs competitors

7. **Timing Matters More Than Quality:** Dome (construction) failed due to sector downturn, not company weakness; don't fight sector headwinds

8. **Fix Before IPO:** Rawabi lesson—declining revenue/margins = automatic rejection; capital markets won't fund turnarounds

9. **Risk Framework:** 100-point assessment across financial (30), positioning (25), execution (25), market conditions (20); need 85+ for low risk

10. **Success Probability:** 85-90% if properly prepared (18+ months, score 85+), only 60-70% if rushed (score <65)
