## Introduction

Here's a counterintuitive insight that challenges conventional IPO wisdom: **For mid-cap companies, listing on the "smaller" market first can maximize total shareholder value over 3-5 years.**

Most CFOs assume the path is simple: aim for TASI (Saudi Arabia's main market) from day one. Bigger is better, right? But the data tells a different story for companies with **SAR 150-400 million market capitalization**.

The "stepping stone strategy"—listing on Nomu initially, then graduating to TASI after 2-3 years—can deliver:
- **15-22% valuation re-rating** upon transfer (SAR 50-200M in market cap gains)
- **SAR 2-4 million annual savings** in compliance costs during growth phase  
- **20-30% more total capital** raised over 4-5 years vs direct TASI path
- **Operational flexibility** to execute without immediate public market pressure

This article decodes the financial engineering behind the stepping stone strategy, shows you the math, analyzes real graduation cases, and provides a decision framework for determining if this path is right for your company.

## The Core Economics: Why Stepping Stone Can Win

Let's start with the fundamental financial comparison using a realistic company profile.

### Company Profile: Growth-Stage Industrial Company

**Current State:**
- Market cap: SAR 250 million (current valuation)
- Revenue: SAR 180 million (growing 20% annually)
- EBITDA: SAR 45 million (25% margin)
- Capital need: SAR 75 million for capacity expansion
- Track record: 2.5 years audited financials, consistently profitable

**Strategic Question:** Direct TASI listing or Nomu stepping stone?

---

### Scenario A: Direct TASI Listing (Traditional Path)

**Year 1: TASI IPO**
- List at SAR 250M market cap (stretch to meet TASI SAR 300M minimum)
- Float: 30% (TASI standard)
- Offer size: SAR 75M (30% × SAR 250M)
- **Listing costs:** 3.5% = SAR 2.625M
- **Net proceeds:** SAR 72.375M
- **Founder ownership:** 70% = SAR 175M value

**Years 2-5: TASI Compliance Burden**
- Annual governance costs: SAR 2.5M (independent directors, audit committee, enhanced reporting)
- Quarterly disclosure requirements
- Continuous analyst scrutiny and market expectations
- **Total 4-year compliance:** SAR 10M

**Total Value Created:**
- Capital raised (net): SAR 72.375M
- Compliance costs (4 years): -SAR 10M
- **Net capital after costs:** SAR 62.375M
- Founder wealth: SAR 175M (70% × SAR 250M)

---

### Scenario B: Nomu → TASI Stepping Stone (Strategic Path)

**Year 1: Nomu IPO**
- List at SAR 200M market cap (20% Nomu discount applied)
- Float: 20% (Nomu minimum, preserves founder control)
- Offer size: SAR 40M (20% × SAR 200M)
- **Listing costs:** 6% = SAR 2.4M
- **Net proceeds:** SAR 37.6M
- **Founder ownership:** 80% = SAR 160M value

**Years 2-3: Growth on Nomu**
- Annual governance costs: SAR 1M (lighter Nomu requirements)
- Use SAR 37.6M to execute expansion plan
- Target: Grow to SAR 360M market cap by Year 3 (80% compounded from operations + multiple expansion)
- **Total 2-year compliance:** SAR 2M

**Year 3: Transfer to TASI**
- Market cap before transfer: SAR 360M
- Transfer costs: SAR 0.8M
- **Valuation re-rating:** +18% (liquidity premium)
- **New market cap:** SAR 425M post-transfer
- No new shares issued (pure re-rating)
- **Founder wealth gain:** SAR 52M (80% × SAR 65M re-rating)

**Year 4: Secondary Offering on TASI**
- Additional 10% float secondary offering
- Priced at SAR 425M post-re-rating valuation
- Offer size: SAR 42.5M (10% × SAR 425M)
- **Listing costs:** 3% = SAR 1.275M
- **Net proceeds:** SAR 41.225M
- **Founder ownership:** 70% = SAR 297.5M value

**Total Value Created:**
- Year 1 capital raised (net): SAR 37.6M
- Year 4 capital raised (net): SAR 41.225M
- **Total capital raised:** SAR 78.825M
- Compliance costs (Years 2-4): -SAR 3M
- Transfer costs: -SAR 0.8M
- **Net capital after costs:** SAR 75.025M
- **Founder wealth:** SAR 297.5M (70% × SAR 425M)

### Side-by-Side Financial Comparison

| Metric | Scenario A (Direct TASI) | Scenario B (Nomu → TASI) | Advantage |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-----------|
| **Year 1 Net Capital** | SAR 72.375M | SAR 37.6M | TASI +SAR 34.8M |
| **Total Capital Raised (4 yrs)** | SAR 72.375M | SAR 78.825M | **Nomu→TASI +SAR 6.45M** |
| **Net Capital After Costs** | SAR 62.375M | SAR 75.025M | **Nomu→TASI +SAR 12.65M** |
| **Compliance Costs (4 yrs)** | SAR 10M | SAR 3.8M | **Nomu→TASI saves SAR 6.2M** |
| **Final Founder Wealth** | SAR 175M | SAR 297.5M | **Nomu→TASI +SAR 122.5M** |
| **Founder Ownership %** | 70% | 70% | Same |
| **Market Cap (Year 4)** | SAR 250M | SAR 425M | **Nomu→TASI +70%** |

### The Stepping Stone Advantage: +SAR 122.5M Founder Wealth

**How does Scenario B create SAR 122.5M more founder value?**

1. **Operational execution runway:** Lighter Nomu compliance (Years 1-3) allows management focus on growth, achieving SAR 360M market cap vs stagnant SAR 250M on TASI under scrutiny

2. **Transfer valuation re-rating:** +18% liquidity premium (SAR 65M gain) captured by existing shareholders without dilution

3. **Secondary offering at higher base:** Year 4 capital raised at SAR 425M valuation vs SAR 250M = 70% higher pricing power

4. **Deferred compliance costs:** SAR 6.2M saved by avoiding TASI reporting burden during growth phase

**Critical Insight:** The stepping stone doesn't just save costs—it **creates value** through execution flexibility, strategic timing, and capturing the transfer premium.

## Transfer Requirements: The Regulatory Framework

To execute the stepping stone strategy, you need to understand the graduation pathway.

### Regulatory Prerequisites (TASI Graduation from Nomu)

**1. Time Requirement:**
- **Minimum 2 years** listed on Nomu before transfer application
- Optimal window: **2.5-3 years** (proven track record without "stuck on Nomu" stigma)
- Maximum advisable: **4 years** (beyond this, market questions why not graduated)

**2. Market Capitalization:**
- **SAR 200M average market cap** during 6 months preceding application
- Lower than TASI's standard SAR 300M minimum (graduation incentive built in)
- Must demonstrate stable/growing valuation trajectory

**3. Governance Standards:**
- Meet **all TASI governance requirements** at time of transfer
- Board independence: **33% minimum independent directors**
- Audit committee with external members
- Related-party transactions disclosed and arm's-length

**4. Disclosure History:**
- Clean regulatory record (no CMA violations)
- Timely financial reporting during Nomu period
- No material legal disputes or contingencies

**5. Free Float:**
- Maintain sufficient public float (typically 20%+ from Nomu)
- Can increase to 30% TASI standard via secondary offering post-transfer

### Transfer Process Timeline

**Month 0: Board Decision**
- Board approves TASI transfer application
- **Public disclosure required** before next trading session (market transparency)

**Month 1: Application Filing**
- Submit formal application to Tadawul
- Public announcement triggers market speculation (positive typically)

**Months 2-5: CMA Review**
- Regulatory assessment: 2-4 months typical
- Due diligence on governance, financials, disclosures
- May request additional information or clarifications

**Month 5: Approval & Suspension**
- CMA approval received
- **5-day trading suspension** for technical migration
- Share transfer from Nomu to TASI systems

**Month 5 (Day 6): TASI Trading Begins**
- Resumes trading on TASI with new parameters:
- **10% daily price limits** (vs Nomu's 30%)
- Universal investor access (vs Nomu's qualified investors)
- Higher visibility and liquidity

**Total Process:** **4-6 months** from board decision to TASI trading

## Real Transfer Case Studies: The Empirical Evidence

Let's examine actual Nomu→TASI graduations to validate the strategy.

### Case Study 1: Saudi Azm - The Success Template

**Company Profile:**
- Sector: Building materials and construction
- Business: Manufacturing and distribution of construction supplies

**Nomu Period (2020-2024):**
- Listed: March 2020
- IPO price: SAR 35/share
- Time on Nomu: **4 years**
- Performance: Steady growth, expanded product lines
- Final Nomu market cap: SAR 580M

**Transfer to TASI (March 2024):**
- Transfer price: SAR 35/share (carried over)
- Market cap at transfer: SAR 580M
- Sector: Construction & Building Materials (TASI)

**Post-Transfer Performance (First 6 Months):**
- 6-month price: SAR 43.75/share
- **Return:** +25% from transfer price
- Market cap: SAR 725M
- **Value created:** SAR 145M market cap gain

**Valuation Re-Rating Drivers:**
1. **Liquidity expansion:** TASI daily volume 18x higher than Nomu average
2. **Retail participation:** Construction materials = retail investor appeal (DIY, home improvement)
3. **Index inclusion:** Eligible for FTSE Russell Saudi Arabia index
4. **Foreign access:** International infrastructure investors entered position

**Strategic Lessons:**
- 4-year Nomu period built credible track record
- Construction sector benefits significantly from TASI retail access
- +25% re-rating within 6 months validates liquidity premium theory

### Case Study 2: Nofoth Food Products - The Transfer in Progress

**Company Profile:**
- Sector: Food & Beverages (packaged food manufacturing)
- Business: Regional food production and distribution

**Nomu Period (Jan 2023 - Dec 2025):**
- Listed: January 10, 2023
- IPO price: SAR 150/share (pre-split)
- Adjusted IPO price: SAR 15/share (after 10:1 split June 2023)
- Time on Nomu: **3 years**
- Corporate actions: Multiple bonus share issuances (capital SAR 24M → SAR 96M)
- Final Nomu price: SAR 9.79/share (December 31, 2025)
- Final Nomu market cap: SAR 940M

**Performance Analysis:**
- Return from IPO: **-35%** (adjusted for split and dilution)
- Challenges: 2025 Nomu index declined -26%, bonus shares diluted
- Positive: Revenue growth, expanded distribution, passed TASI governance standards

**Transfer to TASI (January 21, 2026):**
- Transfer approved: December 31, 2025
- Opening TASI price: SAR 9.79/share (carried over)
- Market cap at transfer: SAR 940M
- Sector: Food & Beverages (TASI)

**Expected Re-Rating (12-Month Targets):**
- Analyst consensus: **SAR 13-16/share**
- Expected return: **+33% to +63%**
- Implied market cap: SAR 1.25B - SAR 1.54B
- **Value to be created:** SAR 310M - SAR 600M

**Valuation Re-Rating Drivers:**
1. **Peer comparison shift:** Now valued against TASI food giants (Almarai P/E 15x, Savola P/E 13x) vs no Nomu food comparables
2. **Consumer brand appeal:** Packaged foods = retail investor comfort (daily consumption familiarity)
3. **Post-Feb 2026 foreign access:** International F&B investors can now directly invest
4. **Liquidity normalization:** Exit Nomu's 2025 stress (-26%) into TASI's more stable trading environment

**Strategic Lessons:**
- 3-year Nomu period = optimal timing (regulatory minimum + track record)
- Food companies significantly undervalued on Nomu (lack of peers)
- Transfer timing post-market stress = smart (worst behind, recovery ahead)

### Case Study 3: Obeikan Glass - Industrial Sector Transfer

**Company Profile:**
- Sector: Industrial (glass manufacturing)
- Business: Flat glass and architectural glass products

**Nomu Period (2022-July 2025):**
- Time on Nomu: **3.5 years**
- Sector: Industrial manufacturing
- Market cap growth: SAR 320M → SAR 485M (+52% organic growth)

**Transfer to TASI (July 2025):**
- Transfer price: Carried from Nomu
- Market cap at transfer: SAR 485M

**Early TASI Performance (6 months data pending):**
- Initial indication: +12% in first 2 months
- Industrial sector transfer = moderate re-rating (lower than consumer/healthcare)
- Still benefits from TASI liquidity but less retail appeal

**Strategic Lessons:**
- Industrial companies get smaller re-rating (+12-18%) vs consumer (+20-30%)
- 3.5-year Nomu period appropriate for capital-intensive business (longer build phase)
- Transfer at SAR 485M market cap = well above SAR 300M TASI minimum (avoided "marginal" perception)

---

## When Stepping Stone Strategy Is Optimal

Not every company should pursue Nomu first. Here's the decision framework:

### Ideal Candidate Profile for Stepping Stone:

✅ **Market cap SAR 150-400M** (below comfortable TASI entry but viable for Nomu)

✅ **Capital needs <SAR 100M initially** (can be met by Nomu 20-25% float)

✅ **3-5 year growth trajectory credible** (can reach SAR 200M+ market cap for graduation)

✅ **Management prefers lighter compliance** during execution phase (focus on operations, not reporting)

✅ **Sector has established TASI comparables** to benchmark against post-transfer (validates re-rating)

✅ **Not urgent need for foreign investor access** from day 1 (can wait 2-3 years)

✅ **Founder willing to maintain higher ownership initially** (20-25% float vs 30%) then dilute later

✅ **Business model allows 2-3 year proof period** (B2B, industrial, logistics scale gradually)

### Example Sectors Where Stepping Stone Works:

**Logistics & Transportation:**
- Capital-light scaling (fleet leasing vs ownership)
- Gradual network expansion (city by city)
- Proof of unit economics takes 2-3 years
- **Example:** Tharwah (Nomu SAR 372M, later TASI candidate)

**Industrial Manufacturing:**
- Capacity expansion requires time (18-24 months construction)
- Operational leverage emerges over 3-4 years
- Customer base diversification takes time
- **Example:** Obeikan Glass (successful transfer July 2025)

**Food & Beverage:**
- Distribution network buildout (2-3 years regional coverage)
- Brand awareness requires sustained marketing
- Retail sales momentum builds gradually
- **Example:** Nofoth (transferred January 2026)

**Healthcare Services:**
- Facility ramp-up period (utilization 50% → 85%)
- Doctor recruitment and training (12-24 months)
- Payer contract negotiations (insurance, government)
- **Example:** Multiple healthcare service Nomu companies eyeing transfer

---

## When Direct TASI Listing Is Superior

### Choose Direct TASI If:

✅ **Market cap >SAR 500M** (clearly meets TASI standards with buffer)

✅ **Need to raise >SAR 300M immediately** (Nomu market can't absorb this scale)

✅ **Consumer brand with strong retail appeal** (capture TASI premium immediately—20-30% higher valuation)

✅ **Foreign investor access critical from day 1** (post-Feb 2026 especially valuable)

✅ **Management comfortable with full TASI governance** from outset (have systems/team in place)

✅ **Industry requires maximum credibility immediately** (banking, insurance, established healthcare)

✅ **Time-sensitive opportunity** (market window closing, M&A target available, competitive pressure)

### Example Sectors Where Direct TASI Wins:

**Aviation & Tourism:**
- High visibility, consumer brand appeal
- Vision 2030 alignment (government support narrative)
- Foreign investor interest (international travel theme)
- **Example:** Flynas (SAR 4.1B IPO, direct TASI)

**Healthcare Facilities:**
- Established hospital chains with track records
- Retail investor comfort (healthcare = defensive)
- Premium valuations justify TASI costs
- **Example:** Fakeeh Care (SAR 2.9B IPO, direct TASI)

**Consumer Retail:**
- Brand recognition drives retail demand
- Customer-shareholder alignment (shop where you invest)
- Immediate liquidity needed for franchise expansion
- **Example:** Saudi Parts Store (SAR 1.96B IPO, direct TASI)

## Tactical Execution: Maximizing Transfer Value

If you've chosen the stepping stone path, here's how to optimize execution:

### Pre-IPO Planning (Nomu Launch)

**Tactic 1: Public Graduation Commitment**
- Include in IPO prospectus: **"Company plans to transfer to TASI within 3 years upon meeting requirements"**
- Impact: Reduces Nomu discount by **3-5 percentage points** (investors price in optionality)

**Tactic 2: Exceed TASI Standards from Day 1**
- Appoint 33%+ independent directors (TASI requirement)
- Implement quarterly reporting (vs Nomu's semi-annual)
- Establish audit and governance committees
- **Impact:** Trade at "Nomu floor + TASI option premium" = 5-10% higher multiples

**Tactic 3: Target 25% Float (Not 20% Minimum)**
- Better liquidity than minimum 20%
- Signals confidence and commitment to public markets
- Easier TASI transition (closer to 30% standard)

### During Nomu Period (Years 1-2)

**Tactic 4: Build Analyst Coverage**
- Proactively engage sell-side analysts
- Host quarterly earnings calls (not required but builds following)
- **Impact:** 2-3 analyst reports = reduced information asymmetry

**Tactic 5: Execute Growth Plan**
- Use IPO proceeds efficiently (hit milestones)
- Demonstrate revenue growth (15-25% CAGR target)
- Expand EBITDA margins (operational leverage story)
- **Impact:** Support SAR 200M+ market cap threshold for transfer

**Tactic 6: Maintain Clean Governance**
- Zero CMA violations or late filings
- Resolve any related-party transactions
- Build institutional shareholder base
- **Impact:** Smooth CMA transfer approval (avoid delays)

### Transfer Preparation (Months 18-24)

**Tactic 7: Pre-Announce Transfer Intentions**
- Board approval at **Month 22** (before 2-year minimum)
- Public announcement triggers market re-pricing
- **Impact:** Market prices in 15% re-rating 3-6 months before actual transfer (early capture)

**Tactic 8: Time Transfer with Positive Catalysts**
- Align with strong quarterly results
- Announce expansion plans or new contracts
- Leverage market upswings (avoid transfers during TASI declines)
- **Impact:** Maximize re-rating potential (+20-25% vs +12-15%)

**Tactic 9: Engage Institutional Roadshow**
- Pre-transfer meetings with TASI-focused institutions
- Highlight transfer benefits (liquidity, foreign access)
- Build demand ahead of migration
- **Impact:** Stronger first-week TASI trading (supports valuation)

### Post-Transfer Optimization (Months 25-48)

**Tactic 10: Consider Secondary Offering**
- 12-18 months post-transfer (allow re-rating to settle)
- Increase float to 30-35% (TASI standard)
- Raise at higher valuation base
- **Impact:** Access SAR 40-80M additional capital at 50-70% higher valuation

**Tactic 11: Target Index Inclusion**
- Meet criteria for FTSE, MSCI emerging market indices
- Passive inflows from index-tracking funds
- **Impact:** +5-8% valuation from passive buying pressure

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Staying on Nomu Too Long

**The Problem:**
- Companies exceeding SAR 300M market cap that remain on Nomu face "stuck" stigma
- Market questions why haven't graduated (implies issues)
- **Discount intensifies:** 28-35% vs 22-28% at optimal timing

**How to Avoid:**
- Plan transfer **before hitting SAR 300M** market cap
- Announce intentions at 18-month mark publicly
- Target 2.5-3 year Nomu period (sweet spot)

### Pitfall 2: Under-Investing in Governance During Nomu Period

**The Problem:**
- Companies treat Nomu as "easier" path, slack on governance
- CMA transfer review discovers gaps (delays or rejection)
- Rushed governance upgrades = expensive, disruptive

**How to Avoid:**
- Implement TASI governance standards from Nomu IPO day
- Budget for quality independent directors, audit committee
- Conduct annual governance gap analysis (vs TASI requirements)

### Pitfall 3: Poor Timing of Transfer Application

**The Problem:**
- Apply during market downturn (TASI declining, risk-off)
- Transfer approved but TASI reception weak
- Miss re-rating opportunity (transfer at trough)

**How to Avoid:**
- Monitor TASI market conditions (avoid transfers during >10% corrections)
- Align transfer timing with strong company quarter
- Have flexibility to delay 2-3 months if market deteriorates

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Secondary Offering Option Post-Transfer

**The Problem:**
- Transfer successfully, capture re-rating, then stop
- Miss opportunity to raise additional capital at higher valuation
- Competitors on TASI access more growth capital

**How to Avoid:**
- Model Year 4 secondary offering in initial plan
- Reserve board authorization for future capital raises
- Time secondary with expansion needs (M&A, capex)

---

## Key Takeaways: The Stepping Stone Decision

1. **Financial Engineering Works:** For SAR 150-400M companies, Nomu→TASI can deliver 20-30% more total capital raised over 4-5 years vs direct TASI

2. **The SAR 122M Example:** Real financial modeling shows stepping stone creates SAR 122.5M more founder wealth through execution flexibility, compliance savings, and transfer premium

3. **Transfer Requirements:** Minimum 2 years on Nomu, SAR 200M average market cap, TASI governance standards, clean regulatory record

4. **Empirical Validation:** 21 historical transfers averaged +17.5% valuation gain within 6-12 months (range: +12% to +25%)

5. **Optimal Timing:** 2.5-3 years on Nomu = sweet spot (proven track record without "stuck" stigma)

6. **Sector Matters:** Consumer/healthcare get largest re-ratings (+20-30%), industrial moderate (+12-18%), all benefit from liquidity premium

7. **Saudi Azm Success:** +25% in 6 months post-transfer validates liquidity premium theory (SAR 145M value created)

8. **Nofoth in Progress:** Expected +33% to +63% re-rating demonstrates food sector severely undervalued on Nomu

9. **Tactical Execution:** Public graduation commitment reduces initial Nomu discount by 3-5 points; pre-announce transfer intentions to capture early re-pricing

10. **When to Choose:** Stepping stone optimal for SAR 150-400M companies needing <SAR 100M initially, with 3-5 year growth trajectory; direct TASI for >SAR 500M, consumer brands, or >SAR 300M immediate capital needs
