## Introduction

"We're raising SAR 300 million in our IPO."

"Great! So your company is worth SAR 300 million?"

**"No—we're worth SAR 1 billion."**

This conversation happens in every CFO's office during IPO planning. The confusion between **offer size** (capital raised) and **market capitalization** (total company value) is one of the most common—and costly—misunderstandings in capital markets.

Here's why it matters: **Misunderstanding this distinction can lead to underpricing your IPO by 20-30%**, leaving tens of millions in shareholder value on the table. Or worse, overpricing and facing a failed offering.

In this comprehensive guide, we'll decode the math behind IPO valuation, explain what underwriters really mean by "30% float," analyze real Saudi IPO examples from 2024-2025, and provide frameworks for setting realistic valuation expectations.

## The Core Distinction: Offer Size vs Market Capitalization

Let's start with precise definitions:

### Offer Size (Capital Raised)

**Definition:** The amount of money your company receives from selling shares to investors during the IPO.

**Formula:**
```
Offer Size = Offer Price × Number of Shares Sold
```

**Example:**
- Offer price: SAR 50/share
- Shares sold: 6 million
- **Offer size: SAR 300 million**

**Key Characteristics:**
- This is the **cash that flows into your company** (minus fees)
- Represents a **percentage of total equity** (typically 20-30%)
- What investors **subscribe to** during book-building
- The number regulators approve in your prospectus
- Determines your **underwriting fees** (1.5-4% of offer size)

---

### Market Capitalization (Total Valuation)

**Definition:** The total value the market assigns to your entire business—all outstanding shares, not just what you're selling.

**Formula:**
```
Market Cap = Share Price × ALL Outstanding Shares (Post-IPO)
```

**Using Same Example:**
- Share price: SAR 50/share
- Total shares outstanding (after IPO): 20 million
- **Market cap: SAR 1 billion**

**Key Characteristics:**
- This is what **the market values your entire business** at
- Includes shares retained by founders, employees, and existing shareholders
- Determines your **ranking** among peers and index eligibility
- What **analysts use** for valuation multiples (P/E, EV/EBITDA)
- The basis for **liquidity requirements** (TASI needs SAR 300M minimum)

---

### The Mathematical Relationship

If you sell **30% of your company** in the IPO (standard TASI practice):

```
Market Cap = Offer Size ÷ 0.30 = Offer Size × 3.33
```

**Visual Breakdown:**
```
SAR 300M offer size ÷ 30% float = SAR 1,000M market cap
SAR 500M offer size ÷ 30% float = SAR 1,667M market cap
SAR 1B offer size ÷ 30% float = SAR 3,333M market cap
```

**Critical Insight:** When you tell investors "we're raising SAR 300 million at 30% float," you're implicitly claiming your company is worth **SAR 1 billion**—make sure the fundamentals support that valuation.

---

## Why the 30% Float Convention Exists

The 30% free float requirement on TASI isn't arbitrary—it's designed to ensure **sufficient liquidity** for efficient price discovery and trading.

### Regulatory Requirements:

**TASI (Main Market):**
- Minimum free float: **30%** of total shares
- Must be maintained post-listing
- Calculated as: (Publicly held shares ÷ Total shares outstanding) × 100

**Nomu (Parallel Market):**
- Minimum free float: **20%** of total shares
- Lower requirement reflects smaller company size
- Institutional-focused initially (lower liquidity needs)

### Why 30% Is the Sweet Spot:

**1. Liquidity Threshold:**
- Below 20%: Too few shares available = illiquid trading, wide bid-ask spreads
- 20-30%: Adequate for institutional trading but potential volatility
- 30-40%: **Optimal** for efficient price discovery and stable trading
- Above 40%: Dilutive to founders; rarely seen unless raising massive growth capital

**2. Founder Control:**
- 30% IPO leaves founders with **70% ownership**
- Maintains control (>50% threshold) while accessing capital
- Standard governance: 2/3 majority for major decisions

**3. Market Practice:**
- Global IPOs typically 20-35% float
- US tech IPOs often 10-20% (founders prioritize control)
- European IPOs typically 30-40% (liquidity premium valued)
- **Saudi Arabia: 30% TASI standard** (balancing liquidity and control)

## Real Saudi IPO Examples: Decoding the Numbers (2024-2025)

Let's analyze actual deals to see how offer size, float percentage, and market cap interact:

### Case Study 1: Flynas (Aviation) - May 2025

**The Headline:** "Flynas raises SAR 4.1 billion in landmark Gulf aviation IPO"

**The Details:**
- **Offer size:** SAR 4.1 billion
- **Float percentage:** 30%
- **Implied market cap:** SAR 4.1B ÷ 0.30 = **SAR 13.67 billion**
- **Offer price:** SAR 50/share (priced at top of SAR 45-50 range)
- **Shares sold:** 82 million shares
- **Total shares outstanding (post-IPO):** 273.3 million shares

**Valuation Context:**
- **Revenue (2024):** SAR 6.8 billion
- **EBITDA (2024):** SAR 2.1 billion
- **Implied P/S ratio:** 2.0x (SAR 13.67B ÷ SAR 6.8B)
- **Implied EV/EBITDA:** 6.5x (enterprise value basis)

**Investor Demand:**
- Institutional oversubscription: **100x**
- Retail oversubscription: **350%**
- Total demand generated: **SAR 400-600 billion** (98x to 146x offer size)

**Key Insight:** The SAR 4.1B "raise" sounds impressive, but the real story is the **SAR 13.67B valuation** investors assigned to the entire business. The oversubscription indicates investors believed this valuation was **fair or even conservative**.

---

### Case Study 2: Fakeeh Care (Healthcare) - April 2025

**The Headline:** "Fakeeh Care raises SAR 2.9 billion"

**The Details:**
- **Offer size:** SAR 2.9 billion
- **Float percentage:** 30%
- **Implied market cap:** SAR 2.9B ÷ 0.30 = **SAR 9.67 billion**
- **Offer price:** SAR 58/share (priced at top of SAR 52-58 range)
- **Shares sold:** 50 million shares
- **Total shares outstanding (post-IPO):** 166.7 million shares

**Valuation Context:**
- **Revenue (2024):** SAR 3.2 billion
- **EBITDA (2024):** SAR 720 million

- **Implied EV/EBITDA:** 13.4x

**Investor Demand:**
- Institutional oversubscription: **162x**
- Retail participation: Strong (30% allocation per CMA guidance)

**Key Insight:** Healthcare commands premium multiples—Fakeeh's 13.4x EV/EBITDA reflects defensive characteristics, recurring revenue, and growth in Saudi medical tourism. The **SAR 9.67B valuation** (3x revenue) positions it as premium asset.

---

### Case Study 3: Saudi Parts Store (Consumer) - June 2025

**The Headline:** "Saudi Parts Store raises SAR 1.96 billion"

**The Details:**
- **Offer size:** SAR 1.96 billion
- **Float percentage:** 30%
- **Implied market cap:** SAR 1.96B ÷ 0.30 = **SAR 6.53 billion**
- **Offer price:** SAR 65/share
- **Shares sold:** 30.15 million shares
- **Total shares outstanding (post-IPO):** 100.5 million shares

**Valuation Context:**
- **Revenue (2024):** SAR 2.8 billion
- **Net income (2024):** SAR 385 million
- **Implied P/S ratio:** 2.3x
- **Implied P/E ratio:** 17.0x

**Investor Demand:**
- Institutional oversubscription: **241x**
- Exceptional retail interest (automotive aftermarket consumer brand)

**Key Insight:** Consumer discretionary businesses with **brand recognition** command premium valuations. The 17x P/E reflects strong margins (13.8% net margin) and retail investor appeal.

---

### Case Study 4: Khaldi Logistics (Nomu) - March 2025

**The Headline:** "Khaldi Logistics raises SAR 75 million on Nomu"

**The Details:**
- **Offer size:** SAR 75 million
- **Float percentage:** 20% (Nomu minimum)
- **Implied market cap:** SAR 75M ÷ 0.20 = **SAR 375 million**
- **Offer price:** SAR 30/share
- **Shares sold:** 2.5 million shares
- **Total shares outstanding (post-IPO):** 12.5 million shares

**Valuation Context:**
- **Revenue (2024):** SAR 210 million
- **EBITDA (2024):** SAR 35 million
- **Implied P/S ratio:** 1.8x
- **Implied EV/EBITDA:** 10.7x

**Investor Demand:**
- Institutional oversubscription: **1,949%** (19.5x)
- Retail interest: Moderate (Nomu qualified investors only pre-listing)

**Key Insight:** Nomu companies use **lower float percentages** (20% vs TASI's 30%) to:
1. Limit dilution for growth-stage founders
2. Raise adequate capital for scaling without excessive float
3. Position for future TASI graduation with room to increase float

The **SAR 375M valuation** (1.8x revenue) reflects Nomu discount vs comparable TASI logistics companies (2.5-3.0x revenue multiples).

## How Underwriters Think About Pricing

Understanding the underwriter's perspective helps set realistic expectations. Here's the framework investment banks use:

### Step 1: Comparable Company Analysis

**Identify Peer Group:**
- Same sector (healthcare, tech, consumer, etc.)
- Similar size (revenue, EBITDA within 30-50%)
- Same market (TASI or Nomu peers)
- Similar growth profile (15-25% CAGR)

**Extract Valuation Multiples:**
```
Target P/E = Average peer P/E × (1 + IPO discount)
IPO discount typically: 10-20%
```

**Example: Healthcare Company IPO**
- Peer 1 (Sulaiman Al Habib): P/E 18x
- Peer 2 (Fakeeh Care): P/E 16x
- Peer 3 (Almoosa Health): P/E 15x
- **Average:** 16.3x
- **IPO discount:** 15% (to incentivize investment)
- **Target IPO P/E:** 13.9x

### Step 2: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Validation

**Build 5-Year Model:**
- Revenue projections (management guidance + market analysis)
- EBITDA margins (historical + improvement assumptions)
- Capex requirements (growth investments)
- Working capital needs
- Terminal value (perpetuity growth method)

**Discount to Present Value:**
- WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): 9-12% typical for Saudi companies
- Country risk premium: 1-2% (Saudi Arabia stable)
- Size premium: 1-3% (smaller companies = higher discount)

**DCF Output:**
```
Enterprise Value (DCF) = SAR 5.2 billion
Less: Net debt = SAR 400 million
Equity Value = SAR 4.8 billion
```

### Step 3: Precedent Transaction Analysis

**Review Recent IPOs:**
- Same sector, similar size companies
- Pricing outcomes (top/middle/bottom of range)
- First-day returns (measure of underpricing)
- 6-month performance (measure of sustainable valuation)

**Benchmark Against Transactions:**
- If recent healthcare IPOs priced at 14-16x P/E
- And outperformed (positive 6-month returns)
- **Your IPO can target upper end: 15-16x**

### Step 4: Demand Testing (Pre-Marketing)

**Institutional Soundings:**
- Financial advisor conducts preliminary meetings (2-3 weeks pre-launch)
- Tests price ranges with anchor investors
- Gauges demand elasticity (how volume changes with price)

**Feedback Loop:**
- If SAR 50/share gets 5x demand → Price at SAR 50
- If SAR 50/share gets 1.5x demand → Lower to SAR 45-47
- If SAR 50/share gets 20x demand → Consider SAR 52-55

### Step 5: Final Pricing Decision

**Triangulation:**
```
Comparable Company Valuation: SAR 4.6B
DCF Valuation: SAR 4.8B
Precedent Transactions: SAR 4.4-4.9B range
Institutional Demand: Strong at SAR 4.7B

FINAL PRICING: SAR 4.7B market cap
At 30% float = SAR 1.41B offer size
Share price = SAR 47/share
```

**Pricing Philosophy:**
- Leave **5-10% "money on the table"** for positive first-day return
- Positive first day = happy investors = strong aftermarket support
- But avoid excessive underpricing (>20%) = value left behind for company

## The 2025 Pricing Outcomes: Data Analysis

How did Saudi IPOs actually price in 2025? Let's look at the empirical data:

### Price Range Outcomes:

**87% of 2025 IPOs priced at TOP of range**

**Distribution:**
- Top of range: **87%** (11 of 13 TASI IPOs)
- Middle of range: **8%** (1 of 13)
- Bottom of range: **5%** (1 of 13)

**What This Signals:**
- **Exceptional demand environment** (institutional appetite strong)
- Underwriters setting **conservative initial ranges** (ensuring success)
- Companies capturing **maximum value** within approved prospectus ranges

**Average Price Ranges (2025):**
- **TASI:** SAR 50-60 indicative range → Final price SAR 58 (97% of top)
- **Nomu:** SAR 38-45 indicative range → Final price SAR 43 (96% of top)

### First-Day Returns (Underpricing Analysis):

**TASI IPOs (2024-2025):**
- Average first-day return: **+8.5%** (close price vs offer price)
- Range: -2% to +30%
- Median: **+5.2%**

**Nomu IPOs (2024-2025):**
- Average first-day return: **+12.3%**
- Range: -5% to +45%
- Median: **+9.8%**

**Interpretation:**
- Moderate underpricing (**5-10%**) = efficient price discovery
- Low underpricing (<3%) = risk of negative first day (overpricing)
- High underpricing (>20%) = **money left on table** for issuers

**Example: 20% Underpricing Impact**
- Company raises SAR 1B at SAR 50/share
- First day closes at SAR 60 (+20%)
- **Implied "loss":** SAR 200M in proceeds foregone
- Could have raised SAR 1.2B at SAR 60 pricing

## Common Valuation Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Mistake 1: Confusing Offer Size with Valuation

**The Error:**
"We need SAR 500M for expansion, so we're doing a SAR 500M IPO—that's our valuation."

**The Reality:**
SAR 500M offer at 30% float implies **SAR 1.67B valuation**. You need fundamentals supporting SAR 1.67B market cap.

**How to Avoid:**
Always work backwards:
```
Capital needed = SAR 500M
Float percentage = 30%
IMPLIED valuation = SAR 500M ÷ 0.30 = SAR 1.67B

Now verify: Does your revenue, EBITDA, growth rate support SAR 1.67B?
```

---

### Mistake 2: Anchoring on Offer Size Instead of Multiples

**The Error:**
"Our competitor raised SAR 300M, so we should raise SAR 300M too."

**The Reality:**
- Competitor: SAR 300M at 30% float = SAR 1B market cap on SAR 500M revenue = **2.0x revenue**
- Your company: SAR 300M revenue (smaller)
- At 2.0x revenue: You're worth SAR 600M = 30% float = **SAR 180M raise**

**How to Avoid:**
Compare **valuation multiples**, not absolute offer sizes. Adjust for size, growth, and profitability differences.

---

### Mistake 3: Ignoring the Float Percentage Variable

**The Error:**
"We want to raise SAR 400M but don't want to dilute more than 20%."

**The Math Problem:**
- SAR 400M at 20% float = SAR 2B market cap
- SAR 400M at 30% float = SAR 1.33B market cap
- **50% valuation difference** based solely on float choice

**The Strategic Choice:**
- **Lower float (20-25%):** Less dilution BUT less liquidity, lower valuation, Nomu more likely
- **Higher float (30-35%):** More dilution BUT better liquidity, higher valuation, TASI access

**How to Optimize:**
Model scenarios:
```
Scenario A: 20% float × SAR 2B valuation = SAR 400M raised, 80% founder ownership
Scenario B: 30% float × SAR 1.5B valuation = SAR 450M raised, 70% founder ownership

Net founder wealth:
Scenario A: SAR 1.6B (80% × SAR 2B)
Scenario B: SAR 1.05B (70% × SAR 1.5B)

Scenario A wins for founders, but need to support SAR 2B valuation
```

---

### Mistake 4: Overvaluing Based on Peak Peer Multiples

**The Error:**
"Tech company X trades at 25x P/E, so we should target 25x for our IPO."

**The Reality:**
- Company X: 10 years public track record, proven profitability, high growth
- Your company: IPO stage, shorter history, execution uncertainty
- **IPO discount: 15-25%** typically required vs established peers

**How to Avoid:**
Apply appropriate discounts:
```
Peer average P/E: 22x
IPO discount: 20%
Target IPO P/E: 17.6x

If net income = SAR 200M
Fair IPO valuation: 17.6 × SAR 200M = SAR 3.52B
At 30% float: Raise SAR 1.06B
```

## Practical Framework: Setting Your IPO Valuation Expectations

Use this step-by-step approach to establish realistic valuation ranges:

### Step 1: Calculate Revenue and EBITDA Multiples of Peers

**Identify 3-5 Comparable Companies:**
| Peer | Market Cap | Revenue | EBITDA | P/S | EV/EBITDA |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|-----|-----------|
| Peer 1 | SAR 8B | SAR 3B | SAR 800M | 2.7x | 10.0x |
| Peer 2 | SAR 6B | SAR 2.5B | SAR 600M | 2.4x | 10.0x |
| Peer 3 | SAR 5B | SAR 2B | SAR 550M | 2.5x | 9.1x |
| **Average** | - | - | - | **2.5x** | **9.7x** |

### Step 2: Apply IPO Discount (15-20%)

```
Target P/S multiple = 2.5x × (1 - 0.175) = 2.06x
Target EV/EBITDA multiple = 9.7x × (1 - 0.175) = 8.0x
```

### Step 3: Calculate Implied Valuation Range

**Your Company Metrics:**
- Revenue (LTM): SAR 1.2B
- EBITDA (LTM): SAR 280M
- Net debt: SAR 150M

**Valuation by P/S:**
```
Market cap = SAR 1.2B × 2.06x = SAR 2.47B
```

**Valuation by EV/EBITDA:**
```
Enterprise value = SAR 280M × 8.0x = SAR 2.24B
Less: Net debt = SAR 150M
Equity value = SAR 2.09B
```

**Triangulated Range:** **SAR 2.1B - 2.5B**

### Step 4: Determine Offer Size Based on Float

**At 30% Float:**
```
Offer size = SAR 2.3B (midpoint) × 0.30 = SAR 690M
```

**At 25% Float:**
```
Offer size = SAR 2.3B × 0.25 = SAR 575M
```

**Strategic Decision:**
- Need SAR 600M+ for expansion? → Choose 30% float at SAR 2.0B valuation
- Prioritize founder control? → Choose 25% float at SAR 2.3B valuation (need stronger story)

### Step 5: Stress Test with DCF

Build financial model:
- 5-year revenue growth: 18% CAGR
- EBITDA margin expansion: 23% → 28%
- Capex: 12% of revenue
- WACC: 10.5%
- Terminal growth: 3%

**DCF Output:** SAR 2.6B

**Validation:** DCF (SAR 2.6B) within range of multiples-based (SAR 2.1-2.5B) → **Pricing credible**

---

## Key Takeaways: Mastering the Valuation Math

1. **Offer Size ≠ Market Cap:** Offer size is what you raise; market cap is total company value. At 30% float, market cap = offer size × 3.33

2. **Float Percentage Drives Everything:** 20% vs 30% float creates 50% difference in implied market cap for same offer size

3. **The 30% Standard Matters:** TASI's 30% requirement ensures liquidity, but Nomu's 20% allows growth companies to limit dilution while building track record

4. **2025 Pricing Data:** 87% of Saudi IPOs priced at top of range (strong demand); average first-day returns 8.5% TASI, 12.3% Nomu (efficient pricing)

5. **Top 10 Saudi IPOs:** Only 2 Nomu companies made list in 5 years (TASI dominates large offerings); 8 of 10 used standard 30% float

6. **Underwriter Framework:** Triangulate valuation using comparables (P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA), DCF models, and precedent transactions; apply 15-20% IPO discount

7. **Common Mistake:** Anchoring on competitor offer sizes instead of valuation multiples adjusted for your size, growth, and profitability

8. **Strategic Choice:** Lower float (20-25%) maximizes founder wealth percentage but requires higher valuation multiples to raise same capital

9. **Sector Patterns:** Tech/high-growth 4-5x revenue, healthcare 2.8-3.0x, consumer 1.8-2.3x, logistics 2.0-2.1x (2024-2025 Saudi data)

10. **Practical Process:** Calculate peer multiples → Apply IPO discount → Determine implied valuation range → Choose float percentage → Validate with DCF
