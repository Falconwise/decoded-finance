# Equity Risk Premium for Saudi Valuation: Global Base, Country Risk, and Practical Adjustments

Equity Risk Premium (ERP) is one of the most sensitive inputs in valuation. Small changes can move intrinsic value materially.

For Saudi valuations, the objective is to build a transparent ERP that has a global anchor and reflects country exposure only when the business economics justify it.

## 1) Start with a global base ERP
Use a mature market ERP as the starting point. This is appropriate when cash flows are diversified globally or the company is comparable to global peers.

## 2) Add a country risk component when exposure is primarily domestic
If the business is mainly exposed to Saudi domestic conditions, you may add a country risk premium (CRP) using a transparent method:

$$CRP = CDS_{KSA} \times \frac{\sigma_{equity}}{\sigma_{bond}}$$

Then:

$$ERP_{Saudi} = ERP_{global} + CRP$$

This ties country risk to observable sovereign spread proxies and an equity risk scaling factor.

## 3) Match ERP to where revenues and cash flows are earned
A practical approach is to weight ERP by revenue exposure:

$$ERP_{effective} = w_{Saudi} \times ERP_{Saudi} + (1-w_{Saudi}) \times ERP_{global}$$

This is often more accurate than applying a single ERP to a globally exposed firm.

## 4) Concentration risk as a sensitivity (not a claim)
If a business is highly concentrated in a small number of counterparties or projects, you can model a small additional premium as a sensitivity, for example 0.5% to 1.5. Keep it explicitly illustrative and sensitivity-tested.

## 5) Example (illustrative)
Assume:
- $ERP_{global} = 5.5\%$
- $CDS_{KSA} = 1.0\%$
- $\sigma_{equity}/\sigma_{bond} = 1.5$

Then:
$$CRP = 1.5\%$$
$$ERP_{Saudi} = 7.0\%$$

If $w_{Saudi} = 80\%$:
$$ERP_{effective} = 0.8 \times 7.0\% + 0.2 \times 5.5\% = 6.7\%$$

Treat ERP as a range and show sensitivity.
