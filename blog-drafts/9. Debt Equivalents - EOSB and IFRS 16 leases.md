# Debt Equivalents in Saudi Valuation: EOSB, IFRS 16 Leases, and Hidden Leverage

Enterprise value and leverage can be understated if you ignore debt-like obligations outside traditional bank debt.

Two common items are IFRS 16 lease liabilities and end-of-service benefits (EOSB).

## 1) IFRS 16 leases
Use reported lease liabilities as debt-like items. Ensure EBITDA and EV multiples are consistent with lease treatment.

## 2) EOSB as a debt-like obligation
EOSB is not identical to bank debt, but it represents a cash obligation that can be material in downside or restructuring scenarios.

A transparent approach is to treat the reported EOSB liability as a debt equivalent and present valuation with and without this adjustment.

## 3) Enterprise value bridge (illustrative)
$$EV = Equity\ Value + Debt + Lease\ Liabilities + EOSB - Cash$$

## 4) Sensitivity and governance
Show sensitivity and document why EOSB is or is not included in your base case.
