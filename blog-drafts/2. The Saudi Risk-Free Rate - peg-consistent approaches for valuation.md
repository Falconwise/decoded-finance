# The Saudi Risk-Free Rate: Peg-Consistent Approaches for Valuation

In valuation, the risk-free rate is an anchor. It must match the currency of the cash flows and be stated transparently.

For Saudi valuations in SAR, common errors include using SAIBOR as a risk-free rate or mixing USD risk-free rates with SAR cash flows.

This post provides two defensible ways to estimate a SAR-consistent risk-free rate.

## 1) What “risk-free” means in a valuation model
A risk-free rate in valuation should be:
- in the same currency as the cash flows
- matched in tenor to the duration of the cash flows (10-year is a practical benchmark for long-duration models)
- free of default risk in theory, or adjusted explicitly if your market does not provide a perfect proxy

## 2) Approach A: Use a SAR government benchmark (direct method)
If you have a reliable SAR government yield curve, you can use a long tenor SAR government yield as the risk-free proxy.

Pros:
- correct currency
- direct observable benchmark

Cons:
- liquidity conditions can differ from deep markets, which can introduce noise

## 3) Approach B: Build-up using the peg (transparent method)
A practical approach is to start with a USD risk-free rate and add a Saudi sovereign default spread proxy.

$$R_{f,SAR} = R_{f,USD} + CDS_{KSA}$$

This is transparent because each component is observable.

Integrity rule:
If you use a sovereign spread proxy to convert USD $R_f$ to SAR $R_f$, do not add another separate sovereign spread elsewhere unless you explain clearly why and where it belongs to avoid double counting.

## 4) Why SAIBOR is not a risk-free rate
SAIBOR is a bank offered rate. It embeds bank credit risk, liquidity effects, and funding conditions. It is useful for pricing floating-rate debt, not for anchoring the valuation risk-free rate.

## 5) Simple example (illustrative inputs)
Assume:
- $R_{f,USD}$ (10Y): 4.5%
- $CDS_{KSA}$ (10Y): 1.0%

Then:
$$R_{f,SAR} = 4.5\% + 1.0\% = 5.5\%$$

Label these as illustrative unless you are using live market sources.

## 6) Pitfalls checklist
1) Currency mismatch between cash flows and discount rate.
2) Tenor mismatch between risk-free and long-duration cash flows.
3) Double counting sovereign risk in both $R_f$ and ERP without documentation.
