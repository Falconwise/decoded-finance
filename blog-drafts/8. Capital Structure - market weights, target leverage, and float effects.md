# Capital Structure in Saudi Valuation: Market Weights, Target Leverage, and Free Float Effects

Capital structure affects WACC through the weights, and those weights should be defensible.

In Saudi markets, equity market cap can be noisy when float is limited, and market value of debt is often not directly observable.

## 1) Use market weights as the baseline
$$w_e = \frac{E}{D+E}$$
$$w_d = \frac{D}{D+E}$$

## 2) Estimating debt market value in practice
For floating-rate debt, book value is often a reasonable approximation. For fixed-rate debt issued under very different rate conditions, consider a sensitivity.

Document the approximation.

## 3) Target capital structure for decision-grade valuation
If the company has a financing policy or is transitioning, a target leverage approach is often more stable than current market weights. Present both current and target as scenarios.

## 4) Avoid false precision
Show sensitivity to capital structure weights, especially when equity market cap is affected by liquidity conditions.
