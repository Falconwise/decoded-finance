# Cost of Debt in Saudi Valuation: SAIBOR, Sukuk Benchmarks, and Synthetic Ratings

Cost of debt ($K_d$) should represent the company’s current marginal borrowing cost.

In Saudi practice, corporate debt is often priced as SAIBOR plus a credit spread for bank facilities, or as a yield/spread in the sukuk market.

## 1) Facility pricing approach (SAIBOR + spread)
If a facility is priced as SAIBOR plus a margin:

$$K_d \approx SAIBOR + Spread$$

Include recurring fees only if clearly debt-like.

## 2) Sukuk benchmark approach
If the issuer has publicly priced sukuk, use yield to maturity or spreads. Adjust for seniority and tenor. Label the number as indicative unless you are using live pricing.

## 3) Synthetic rating approach
When pricing is not observable, estimate a synthetic spread from credit ratios, then add to risk-free:

$$K_d \approx R_f + Spread_{synthetic}$$

Use a spread range and show sensitivity.

## 4) Tax and Zakat in WACC
For income tax payers, WACC often uses $K_d(1-t)$. For Zakat payers, a conservative default is to use $K_d$ unless a tax shield is clearly documented.
