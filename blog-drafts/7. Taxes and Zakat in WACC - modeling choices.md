# Taxes and Zakat in Saudi WACC: Deductibility, Effective Rates, and Modeling Choices

A common error in Saudi WACC models is importing a foreign after-tax debt formula without checking whether the same interest deductibility exists for the specific entity.

This post provides a clear approach to document tax and Zakat treatment in WACC.

## 1) The textbook structure
$$WACC = w_e K_e + w_d K_d(1-t)$$

This assumes a corporate income tax shield.

## 2) Practical modeling defaults
- Income tax payer: use $K_d(1-t)$ with a documented marginal tax rate.
- Zakat payer: do not assume a conventional corporate income tax shield by default. A conservative approach is to use $K_d$.

## 3) Mixed structures
If a firm is partly subject to income tax and partly to Zakat, you can approximate an effective shield factor and apply it to $K_d$, but this must be aligned with the entity’s actual structure and qualified tax advice where required.

## 4) Sensitivity is mandatory
Show WACC under both cases and show valuation sensitivity to changes in WACC. This is more robust than claiming precision on the tax shield.
